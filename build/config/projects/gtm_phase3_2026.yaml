# GTM Phase 3: Title Cluster Research
# Purpose: Produce role-specific messaging for decision-maker personas
# Timing: Q2 2026

# Focus: How do different buyer personas (CFO, CIO/CTO, VP IT, Procurement, Business Unit)
# evaluate and purchase infrastructure advisory services?
#
# Prerequisite: Phase 1 checkpoint (buyer_journey, channels_competitive, gtm_synthesis)
#              Phase 2 checkpoint (vertical_healthcare, vertical_financial_services)

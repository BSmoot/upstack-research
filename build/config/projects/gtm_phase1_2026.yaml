# GTM Phase 1: Foundation Research
# Purpose: Inform marketing automation deployment and AEO strategy before Q2
#
# Agents: All 5 Layer 1 agents
# - buyer_journey, channels_competitive, customer_expansion (parallel)
# - messaging_positioning (depends on above)
# - gtm_synthesis (depends on all, uses Opus 4.5)

  # Key facts for prompt injection
  business_model: "vendor_reimbursed"
  business_model_description: "Buyers pay nothing - vendors/suppliers pay commission on closed deals"

  key_differentiator: "End-to-end solutions throughout the full technology lifecycle"

  # Trust challenge to research
  trust_challenge: "Buyers skeptical of 'free' advisory - need to validate independence"

# Phase 1 research focus
research_focus:
  primary_questions:
    - "How do enterprise buyers find and evaluate technology advisors?"
    - "What do buyers search when looking for infrastructure help?"
    - "Who influences the technology advisory decision?"
    - "Where do competitors (other advisors) show up in buyer research paths?"
    - "Why do buyers go direct to vendors instead of using advisors?"

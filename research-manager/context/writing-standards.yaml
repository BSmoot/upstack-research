# Writing Standards
# SHARED CONTEXT: Research agents should follow these guidelines for all output
# Goal: Natural communication that's direct and clear

# =============================================================================
# CORE PRINCIPLE
# =============================================================================
# Write like a human, not a language model.
#
# Not minimum words. Not robotic efficiency.
# Writing that sounds like someone you'd want to work with.

# =============================================================================
# LLM PATTERNS TO AVOID
# =============================================================================
avoid_patterns:
  - pattern: "This isn't about X, it's about Y"
    problem: "Performative positioning"
    fix: "Just say Y"

  - pattern: "I need to surface X. Here's X:"
    problem: "Announcing what you're about to do"
    fix: "Just do it"

  - pattern: "Let me explain..."
    problem: "Filler"
    fix: "Start explaining"

  - pattern: "It's important to note that..."
    problem: "If it's important, the content shows it"
    fix: "State the important thing directly"

  - pattern: "This matters because..."
    problem: "Usually redundant after a good explanation"
    fix: "Cut it or integrate the reason naturally"

  - pattern: "Em-dash chains"
    problem: "Overuse breaks reading rhythm"
    fix: "One per paragraph max. Use periods."

  - pattern: "Before we dive into..."
    problem: "Delays the point"
    fix: "Start with the point"

  - pattern: "Here's the thing:"
    problem: "False buildup"
    fix: "Just say the thing"

  - pattern: "Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover"
    problem: "Formal filler words"
    fix: "Use 'And,' 'But,' 'So' instead"

  - pattern: "As mentioned above"
    problem: "Probably repeating yourself"
    fix: "Cut it or restructure"

# =============================================================================
# NATURAL WRITING GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================
natural_writing:
  sentence_rhythm:
    - "Vary sentence length"
    - "Short sentences punch"
    - "Longer ones carry nuance when the thought needs room"

  voice_test:
    - "Read it out loud"
    - "If it sounds like a robot or corporate memo, rewrite it"

  pronouns:
    - "Use 'you' and 'we' like a colleague would"

  contractions:
    - "Contractions are fine"
    - "'It's' beats 'it is' in most contexts"

  paragraph_structure:
    - "One idea per paragraph"
    - "But let ideas connect naturally"

# =============================================================================
# DENSITY GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================
# Stay dense, not terse.

density:
  principle: "Every sentence should add something. Cut filler."

  but_also:
    - "Don't strip out the connective tissue that makes writing flow"

  word_choices:
    cut:
      - "Additionally"
      - "Furthermore"
      - "Moreover"
      - "It should be noted that"
      - "In conclusion"
      - "To summarize"
    prefer:
      - "And"
      - "But"
      - "So"
      - "Still"
      - "Yet"

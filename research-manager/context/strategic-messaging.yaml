  category_thesis: |
    Enterprise IT has a vendor management gap — a permanent, structural hole
    between procurement events where technology vendors operate without
    oversight, accountability, or advocacy on behalf of the customer.

    The average enterprise manages 15-40+ technology vendor relationships
    across connectivity, cloud, security, and communications. Each vendor
    has its own contracts, billing systems, SLAs, escalation paths, renewal
    timelines, and service quirks. The internal IT team is responsible for
    keeping the lights on and driving strategic initiatives. Nobody's job
    description says "audit every invoice from every vendor every month,"
    "read the renewal clause on every contract 90 days before auto-renewal,"
    or "diagnose whether the outage is the carrier's fault or the hardware
    vendor's fault."

    That gap between procurement events is where the real cost lives — and
    it's invisible, because the damage it causes doesn't show up as a line
    item. It shows up as zombie spend (services you're still paying for that
    nobody uses), vendor drift (carriers changing terms without notice),
    escalation failure (no leverage when something breaks), renewal exposure
    (auto-renewals nobody tracked), and knowledge loss (the person who
    negotiated the deal left, and context evaporated).

    This problem is structural, not episodic. It doesn't go away after a
    good purchasing decision. It compounds over time as vendors are added,
    contracts stack up, and institutional knowledge disperses. No existing
    role or function owns it. The CIO owns strategy. The CISO owns risk.
    Procurement owns the buying event. Nobody owns the ongoing health of the
    vendor ecosystem as a whole.

    This is exactly the pattern that creates categories. Gainsight named the
    organizational gap where nobody was responsible for customer success.
    Gong named the intelligence gap where nobody was capturing sales call
    data. CrowdStrike named the detection gap where threats were slipping
    through. The category isn't "technology advisory" — that describes
    UPSTACK's role. The category is the function enterprises need and don't
    have: Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management.

    Category creators capture 74% of incremental market cap growth. UPSTACK's
    CRM data confirms the thesis: only 3.6% of deal losses involve a named
    competitor. 35.4% are no-decision losses — prospects who engaged but
    didn't hear something compelling enough to act. UPSTACK isn't losing a
    competition. It's failing to start one. The category doesn't exist in the
    buyer's mind yet. The highest-leverage messaging investment is making it
    exist.

  category_name: "Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management"

  category_definition: |
    The continuous, proactive discipline of overseeing every vendor
    relationship from evaluation through renewal — optimizing spend,
    enforcing accountability, maintaining institutional knowledge, and
    ensuring the technology portfolio evolves with the business.

  problem_manifestations:
    - name: "Zombie Spend"
      description: |
        Services still being billed that nobody uses. Circuits disconnected
        but never stopped billing. Redundant contracts from acquisitions
        never consolidated. UPSTACK finds 30.6% average cost reduction on
        networking alone across 1,700+ deals — not because enterprises
        negotiate badly, but because nobody watches the portfolio between
        negotiations.

    - name: "Vendor Drift"
      description: |
        Carriers change terms, raise prices, sunset products, modify SLAs,
        change bank accounts, alter routing — and nobody on the customer
        side notices until something breaks. Each incident is small. Across
        30-40 vendor relationships, it's a permanent drag on reliability
        and cost.

    - name: "Escalation Failure"
      description: |
        When something breaks, the internal IT team calls the vendor's
        support line and enters the standard ticket queue. They have no
        leverage, no executive relationships at the carrier, no visibility
        into whether the vendor's response meets SLA. UPSTACK gets
        executive-level intervention — that's not a capability most
        internal teams have, not because they lack skill, but because
        they lack relationship leverage.

    - name: "Renewal Exposure"
      description: |
        Enterprise technology contracts auto-renew with 60-90 day notice
        periods. An enterprise with 30+ vendor relationships has renewal
        events rolling through constantly. Miss one notice window and
        you're locked in at whatever the vendor decides to charge. This is
        one of the most common sources of overspend — not bad original
        deals, but renewals nobody was tracking.

    - name: "Knowledge Loss"
      description: |
        When the person who negotiated the deal leaves, the institutional
        knowledge of what was agreed, why specific terms matter, and what
        leverage exists evaporates. The contract sits in a filing cabinet,
        but the context — "we got this pricing because we threatened to
        consolidate with their competitor" — is gone. The next renewal
        starts from zero.

  framing_rules:
    - rule: "Lead with the problem, not the solution. Spend more time educating on the unmanaged vendor lifecycle gap than describing UPSTACK's services."
      example_bad: "UPSTACK is a vendor-neutral technology advisory firm that evaluates 300+ suppliers on your behalf."
      example_good: "Between procurement events, your technology vendor relationships operate without oversight, accountability, or advocacy. That's where the real cost lives."

    - rule: "Use the five manifestations to make the problem concrete. Never describe it abstractly."
      example_bad: "Companies waste money on technology."
      example_good: "One of our clients was paying $2,000 a month for equipment on circuits that had been disconnected three years earlier. Nobody caught it because nobody was looking."

    - rule: "Position UPSTACK as the category answer, not a service provider. The category is Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management. UPSTACK is the firm that practices it."
      example_bad: "UPSTACK is a technology brokerage / sourcing advisory / IT consulting firm."
      example_good: "Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management is a discipline most enterprises don't have and all of them need. UPSTACK is where it lives."

    - rule: "Adapt language by audience register. C-suite gets portfolio-level language. VP gets operational-burden language. Practitioners get multi-vendor coordination language."
      example_bad: "We manage your technology vendors. (same language regardless of audience)"
      example_good: "C-suite: 'An average of 30+ vendor relationships operating without portfolio-level oversight.' VP: 'Your team spends its time firefighting — not auditing invoices or tracking renewal windows.' Practitioner: 'You manage 30 vendor relationships, each with its own portal, billing format, and support queue.'"

    - rule: "Never claim 'performance-based' compensation or deny commission-based revenue. UPSTACK earns commissions from vendors. Differentiate on how the model is executed, not on a false claim about the model itself."
      example_bad: "We don't earn commissions from any supplier. Our model is performance-based."
      example_good: "Like TSDs, our advisory is vendor-funded — you pay nothing. The difference: curated senior expertise, a proprietary intelligence platform, and a dedicated team that stays through lifecycle management. Our 99.8% retention proves the model produces accountability."

three_pillars:
  status: "POPULATED"

  context: |
    The three pillars describe UPSTACK's differentiation WITHIN the category.
    They operate at a different level than the category creation framework.
    The category framework defines what Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management
    is. The pillars explain why UPSTACK is the best provider of it. Research
    agents should use the category framework to educate on the problem and
    the pillars to differentiate UPSTACK when the audience is already
    problem-aware.

  architecture: |
    CATEGORY DEFINITION (what the discipline is)
    +-- Six service components (the "what")
    +-- Maturity model (the "where are you now")
    +-- Self-assessment tool (the "find out")

    DIFFERENTIATION (why UPSTACK specifically)
    +-- Pillar 1: Vendor-neutral evaluation
    +-- Pillar 2: Expert advisory at zero cost
    +-- Pillar 3: Measurable results, ongoing relationship
        +-- Operational proof (IRIS/Lumopath stories)
        +-- Intelligence advantage (proprietary data flywheel)

  pillars:
    - name: "Vendor-Neutral Evaluation"
      description: "UPSTACK evaluates the full market on your behalf, with no bias, no quotas, and no exclusive vendor relationships influencing recommendations."
      replaces: "Ad-hoc vendor selection where the internal team evaluates whoever responds to an RFP, limited by their own network and the time they can carve out from other responsibilities."
      proof_point_refs:
        - "322 active supplier relationships from a network of 1,272 (brand-assets: general)"
        - "5,759 evaluations completed in trailing 12 months (brand-assets: general)"
        - "Category-specific evaluation volumes and timelines (brand-assets: by_service_category)"
      durability: "Label is permanent. Emphasis should shift from activity framing ('we evaluate') to data-advantage framing ('your evaluation uses intelligence from thousands of comparable deals') by Q2 2026."
      future_proof_language: "Your evaluation is benchmarked against real pricing and outcomes from thousands of comparable deals."
      agent_guidance: |
        When invoking this pillar, lead with what informs the evaluation
        (proprietary data, thousands of comparable deals), not just the
        act of evaluating. Always include the vendor count (300+) and
        the structural neutrality (no quotas, no exclusive relationships).
        Use category-specific evaluation volumes from brand-assets.yaml
        when writing for a specific vertical or technology category.

    - name: "Expert Advisory at Zero Cost"
      description: "Senior-level technology advisory funded by vendors, not the client — delivering the depth of a consulting engagement without the consulting bill."
      replaces: "Paying consultants $200-500/hour for technology guidance, or relying on internal staff whose primary job isn't vendor evaluation and who lack market-wide pricing intelligence."
      proof_point_refs:
        - "101 advisory specialists (brand-assets: general)"
        - "Leadership from RingCentral, 8x8, Oracle, AT&T (brand-assets: communications_voice)"
        - "Average 33-day evaluation cycle (brand-assets: general)"
        - "Category-specific cost reduction data (brand-assets: by_service_category)"
      durability: "Label is permanent — the cost model is structural. Emphasis should shift from credentials-first ('our team comes from...') to judgment + data + leverage framing. Credentials become trust signals, not the lead proof point."
      future_proof_language: "101 advisory specialists, each backed by proprietary intelligence from thousands of comparable engagements."
      agent_guidance: |
        When invoking this pillar, always explain the funding mechanism
        honestly: vendors pay UPSTACK the same commission they'd pay their
        own sales team. UPSTACK earns the same regardless of which vendor
        is selected. The client pays nothing. Use "at no cost to you" or
        "vendor-funded advisory" — never "free" (cheapens value) and
        never "performance-based" (inaccurate). Position the zero-cost
        model as removing the two biggest barriers: budget approval and
        organizational buy-in.

    - name: "Measurable Results, Ongoing Relationship"
      description: "UPSTACK stays through implementation, lifecycle management, and renewal — serving as a single point of contact across all technology vendors with accountability for ongoing results."
      replaces: "One-time vendor selection where the advisor or broker disappears after the procurement event, leaving the enterprise to manage the vendor relationship alone."
      proof_point_refs:
        - "99.8% client retention (brand-assets: general)"
        - "3.5-year average client tenure, growing (brand-assets: general)"
        - "NPS of 78 (brand-assets: general)"
        - "Multi-decade relationships: Visionworks 16yr, WeWork 9yr, Under Armour 10yr"
        - "Operational proof stories from IRIS/Lumopath (see operational_proof section)"
      durability: "Permanent. This is the load-bearing wall among the three pillars. Every proof point describes accountability, operational depth, and relationship durability — none of which are cognitive functions that AI replaces. Should be elevated to primary position in messaging hierarchy."
      future_proof_language: "We stay. Traditional brokers focus on procurement. We manage your vendor relationships from day one through every renewal, every escalation, and every optimization opportunity."
      agent_guidance: |
        This is the most differentiated pillar and should receive the most
        emphasis in all research outputs. Lead with "we stay" as the core
        differentiator. Make it vivid with operational proof: billing
        recovery, escalation intervention, ETF mitigation, zombie spend
        detection. Use retention data (99.8%) and tenure data (3.5 years
        average, with multi-decade flagship relationships) as quantitative
        proof. This pillar actually strengthens as AI advances — the gap
        between "I can evaluate vendors myself with AI" and "someone is
        accountable for my entire vendor ecosystem" becomes more visible.

maturity_model:
  status: "POPULATED"

  name: "Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management Maturity Model"

  purpose: |
    The maturity model is UPSTACK's primary category creation and sales
    qualification tool. It defines the category by showing enterprises
    where they sit on a progression from ad-hoc vendor management to
    optimized lifecycle management. It creates urgency without fear
    ("you're not broken, you're just at level 1 or 2 — there's a better
    way"), positions UPSTACK as the natural Level 3-4 solution, and gives
    sales a qualification framework for every conversation. The TAM expands
    because you're selling the practice of strategic advisory, not a
    specific procurement event.

  levels:
    - level_number: 1
      name: "Ad-Hoc"
      description: "The enterprise manages technology vendors reactively, with no systematic process. Vendor selection happens when something breaks or a contract expires. No one owns the portfolio view."

        - "No centralized view of what's being spent across all technology vendors"
        - "Renewal dates are tracked in spreadsheets — or not tracked at all"

  purpose: |
    UPSTACK's intelligence capabilities exist on a spectrum from verified

  agent_guidance: |
    Default to Layer 1 for all research outputs. Layer 1 language is
    verified, differentiating, and sufficient for compelling messaging.
    Never use Layer 2 or Layer 3 language in playbooks, outreach templates,
    or general content. The flywheel story (permanent sentence above)
    should appear in every piece of content that touches the data
    advantage. When describing the intelligence platform, always frame it
    as a structural advantage emerging from operational depth — not as a
    standalone product feature.

    Key competitive framing: "The cost of generating generic analysis has
    hit zero — any company can throw an LLM at public data. What's scarce
    is proprietary transaction data, domain-specific judgment, and
    integration into the workflows where decisions happen. UPSTACK has all
    three, plus a structural mechanism to compound their value."

    HEALTHCARE NOTE: Do not claim HIPAA compliance verification, BAA
    coverage, or healthcare-grade security capabilities. These are
    documented gaps. Use "compliance-aware technology evaluation" or
    "technology assessments informed by healthcare regulatory requirements"
    as approved alternatives. See brand-assets.yaml healthcare constraint.

champion_enablement:
  status: "POPULATED"

  context: |
    UPSTACK's CRM data reveals a critical insight that reshapes champion
    enablement strategy: 82% of opportunities involve 1-5 stakeholders,
    with an average of 1.9 per deal. This is fundamentally different from
    the generic Forrester benchmark of 25-person buying committees.

    NOTE: The 25-person figure is an external B2B benchmark scoped in
    brand-assets.yaml buyer_intelligence as "EXTERNAL BENCHMARK ONLY."
    All UPSTACK-specific champion enablement content must use the 1.9
    stakeholder CRM data, not the generic benchmark.

    The implication: champion enablement for UPSTACK should be designed
    for decision-maker confidence, not large-committee consensus building.
    The 1-2 people making this decision need clarity and conviction. They
    need to feel smart about the decision, not equipped to persuade 23
    colleagues.

    The 489 no-decision losses (35.4% of all losses) aren't caused by
    organizational complexity. They're caused by insufficient urgency in
    the initial message. The prospect had the authority to act. They chose
    not to. Problem education — not stakeholder mapping — is the
    highest-leverage messaging investment.

  requirements:
    - requirement: "Every piece of content must pass the forward test"
      detail: "Can the person receiving this forward it to their CFO, CISO, or procurement lead without it losing coherence or credibility? If it requires context from a prior conversation to make sense, it fails."

    - requirement: "Provide the answer, not the argument"
      detail: "With 1-2 decision-makers, the champion doesn't need a 10-slide internal business case. They need a clear, specific description of what UPSTACK does, what it costs (nothing), and what proof exists that it works. One page, one email, one conversation."

    - requirement: "Make the cost of inaction specific and personal"
      detail: "The 35.4% no-decision rate means the primary competitor is the status quo. Champion enablement must make the invisible costs of unmanaged vendor relationships visible to the decision-maker — zombie spend, renewal exposure, escalation gaps — in terms that connect to their specific context."

    - requirement: "Pre-answer the obvious objections"
      detail: "Anticipate and answer the two questions every champion faces: 'If it's free, what's the catch?' (vendor-funded model explanation) and 'Don't we already have this?' (maturity model self-assessment)."

vertical_adaptations:
  status: "POPULATED"

  general_guidance: |
    All vertical messaging follows the same architecture: category
    definition -> problem manifestations -> UPSTACK differentiation.
    Vertical-specific adaptations adjust which problem manifestations
    lead (healthcare cares about compliance and patient care continuity;
    financial services cares about regulatory audit trails and trading
    infrastructure), which proof points are most relevant, and which
    register the champion profile requires.

    INTELLIGENCE DENSITY RULE: Lead with intelligence density ("your
    evaluation is informed by X comparable decisions in your industry"),
    not track record ("we've done X deals"). The data is the same; the
    framing inverts from our achievement to their advantage.

  verticals:
    - name: "Healthcare"
      framing_emphasis: "Patient care continuity, compliance-aware technology evaluation, multi-site clinical infrastructure coordination"
      intelligence_density: "Your evaluation is informed by intelligence from 5,500+ comparable healthcare technology decisions — pricing benchmarks, vendor performance data, and implementation patterns that are most robust in healthcare."

      maturity_advancement_triggers: |
        Technology decisions are often decentralized to individual
        facilities or departments, with no enterprise-wide vendor
        strategy. The trigger for maturity advancement is typically a
        compliance event (HIPAA audit finding related to a vendor
        relationship), a major technology refresh (EHR migration, contact
        center modernization), or a consolidation event (M&A that surfaces
        the chaos of managing dozens of disparate vendor relationships
        across acquired entities).

      primary_proof_narratives:
        - "Carrier Misdiagnosis Override (Sephora — demonstrates technical diagnosis capability; healthcare analog: ensuring patient-facing systems stay up by catching what the carrier missed)"
        - "Zombie Billing Recovery (Jackson Lewis — demonstrates the billing audit discipline; directly applicable to healthcare organizations with facilities spread across geographies)"
        - "Rome Health Zoom UCaaS/CCaaS deployment (healthcare-specific: unified clinical and patient communications)"
        - "Chautauqua Center VoIP/athenahealth EHR integration (healthcare-specific: technology integration with clinical systems)"

      # EDIT (Issue 3): Added compliance constraint reminder to champion_profile
      champion_profile: |
        The internal champion in healthcare is typically a VP of IT or
        Director of Infrastructure managing technology across multiple
        clinical sites, often stretched thin between strategic initiatives
        (EHR optimization, telehealth expansion) and operational firefighting
        (outages, vendor issues, compliance requirements). They need
        content that acknowledges the patient care stakes, demonstrates
        compliance awareness, and emphasizes the multi-site coordination
        value. The simplicity message is especially powerful here: these
        leaders are overwhelmed and the prospect of a zero-cost partner
        who handles vendor coordination is immediately appealing.

        COMPLIANCE CONSTRAINT: Do not claim HIPAA compliance verification,
        BAA coverage, or healthcare-grade security audit capability.
        UPSTACK's BAA signing ability is a documented gap pending
        resolution with legal. Use "compliance-aware technology evaluation"
        or "technology assessments informed by healthcare regulatory
        requirements" as approved alternatives. See brand-assets.yaml
        proof_points.by_vertical.healthcare for the full constraint.

    - name: "Financial Services"
      framing_emphasis: "Regulatory audit trails, trading infrastructure reliability, multi-location banking operations, vendor risk management"
      intelligence_density: "Your evaluation is informed by intelligence from 838 financial services technology decisions in the past 12 months alone — the highest deal velocity of any industry we serve."

      maturity_advancement_triggers: |
        Financial services organizations typically advance from Level 1-2
        to Level 3 after a regulatory event (audit finding related to
        vendor management), a major infrastructure incident (trading floor
        connectivity failure), or a compliance modernization initiative
        (PCI DSS recertification that surfaces vendor dependencies).
        M&A activity in banking frequently triggers the need for vendor
        portfolio consolidation across acquired entities.

      primary_proof_narratives:
        - "Sun Capital Partners SD-WAN deployment (flagship verified case study with client quote)"
        - "BankUnited: 272 opportunities, 249 won — demonstrates deep, sustained banking relationship"
        - "Seacoast Bank: 336 opportunities, 297 won — multi-year banking partnership"
        - "D.E. Shaw escalation intervention (demonstrates carrier-level leverage for trading infrastructure)"

      champion_profile: |
        The internal champion in financial services is typically a VP of
        IT Infrastructure or CTO managing technology across trading floors,
        branch networks, and data centers. They operate under regulatory
        scrutiny that makes vendor management decisions higher-stakes than
        in most industries. They need content that demonstrates compliance
        awareness (PCI DSS verified, SOX and GLBA directional only —
        do not overstate), quantifies the operational burden of managing
        vendor relationships across regulated environments, and
        emphasizes the audit trail value of having a single partner
        documenting all vendor interactions.

        COMPLIANCE NOTE: PCI DSS compliance evaluations are verified in
        Salesforce. SOX and GLBA capabilities are directional only —
        use "supports compliance requirements" rather than claiming
        formal programs. See brand-assets.yaml credentials.by_vertical
        for current status.

    - name: "Manufacturing"
      framing_emphasis: "Multi-facility technology coordination, supply chain connectivity, operational continuity across distributed operations"
      intelligence_density: "Your evaluation is informed by intelligence from 2,800+ manufacturing technology decisions — including multi-site deployments across facilities, distribution centers, and supply chain operations."

      maturity_advancement_triggers: |
        Manufacturing organizations typically advance when expansion or
        consolidation events force a reckoning with fragmented vendor
        relationships across facilities. Adding new production lines,
        opening distribution centers, or acquiring competitors all surface
        the hidden cost of managing technology vendor-by-vendor and
        facility-by-facility with no portfolio-level coordination.

      primary_proof_narratives:
        - "Taylor Farms: 152/154 opportunities won, $30.3K active MRR, 20+ facilities across U.S. and Canada — flagship manufacturing relationship demonstrating multi-site coordination value"
        - "Zombie Billing Recovery (Jackson Lewis — demonstrates billing audit discipline applicable to multi-facility operations)"
        - "Carrier Misdiagnosis Override (Sephora — demonstrates technical diagnosis capability; manufacturing analog: keeping production-critical connectivity running)"

      champion_profile: |
        The internal champion in manufacturing is typically a VP of IT
        or Director of Infrastructure managing technology across production
        facilities, distribution centers, and corporate offices — often
        with limited on-site IT staff at each location. They need content
        that emphasizes the operational complexity of coordinating vendors
        across dozens of facilities, the cost of connectivity downtime
        in production environments, and the bandwidth relief of having
        a single partner who manages vendor relationships across all
        locations. The Taylor Farms story resonates strongly here —
        it demonstrates exactly the multi-site, multi-vendor coordination
        that manufacturing IT leaders struggle with.

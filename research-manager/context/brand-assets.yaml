methodology:
  name: "UPSTACK Advisory Process"
  tagline: "Vendor-neutral technology advisory from evaluation through lifecycle management, at no cost to the client."
  steps:
    - name: "Discovery & Assessment"
      description: "Deep-dive into current technology environment, contracts, business requirements, and stakeholder priorities. We map your existing infrastructure, identify pain points, and align internal teams on evaluation criteria."
    - name: "Strategy & Solution Design"
      description: "Build requirements matrices, develop evaluation frameworks, and architect solutions across hundreds of vendors. We apply pricing intelligence from real-world transactional data to benchmark your current spend and identify optimization opportunities."
    - name: "Sourcing & Evaluation"
      description: "Manage the vendor evaluation process with data-driven scorecards informed by thousands of completed engagements. We run side-by-side comparisons, negotiate pricing and contract terms, and present scored recommendations tied to your specific requirements."
    - name: "Implementation & Deployment"
      description: "Dedicated project management through deployment. We coordinate across vendors, track milestones, manage escalations, and ensure solutions are delivered on time — averaging 76 days from selection to go-live."
    - name: "Lifecycle Management"
      description: "Ongoing vendor coordination, contract renewal management, trouble ticket resolution, and strategic account reviews. We serve as your single point of contact across all technology vendors, continuously optimizing your environment as your business evolves."
  description: "UPSTACK's advisory process takes enterprises from technology assessment through ongoing lifecycle management. Every recommendation is informed by real-world transactional data, delivered by experienced advisors, and backed by dedicated implementation and support teams. The entire engagement costs you nothing — our fees are reimbursed by the vendors you select."
  differentiators:
    - "Zero cost to the client — vendor-reimbursed model eliminates upfront fees and hourly billing"
    - "Vendor-neutral across 300+ suppliers — no quotas, no exclusive relationships, no biased incentives"
    - "Data-driven evaluation using transactional intelligence from thousands of completed engagements"
    - "End-to-end engagement from evaluation through ongoing lifecycle management, not just procurement"
    - "Dedicated CX team with project managers and customer success managers assigned to every engagement"
    - "Proprietary technology platform for inventory management, price benchmarking, and vendor coordination"
    - "Average 33-day evaluation-to-decision cycle — 12 days for networking, under 90 days even for complex CX transformations"

    situation: "Sun Capital Partners, a growing investment firm, operated on an expensive and outdated MPLS network delivering just 100Mbps per location. Frequent service issues caused IT leaders to spend late nights troubleshooting, and the network couldn't support expanding global operations."
    approach: "UPSTACK conducted a deep requirements analysis across Sun Capital's five key locations (NY, LA, Fort Lauderdale, London, Edison) and recommended a comprehensive migration to global SD-WAN with dedicated internet access. Lumen was selected as primary provider after competitive evaluation against GTT and New Horizon Communications."
    outcome: "The firm upgraded from 100Mbps to 1Gbps dedicated internet access — a 10x bandwidth improvement — with redundant, diverse connections eliminating single points of failure. The engagement expanded to serve Sun Capital's portfolio companies, generating 40 closed-won opportunities and $2,041 in ongoing monthly revenue."

positioning_lines:
  vendor_neutral_intro: >
    We work with over 300 technology vendors across data center, networking, cloud, security, and communications — but we don't represent any of them. We represent you. Our advisory team evaluates the full market against your specific requirements, using pricing intelligence from thousands of completed engagements to ensure you're getting the right solution at the right price. There are no quotas, no exclusive relationships, and no biased incentives influencing our recommendations.

  trust_model_explanation: >
    Our fees are reimbursed by the vendor you select — not by you. That sounds unusual, so here's why it works: vendors pay us the same commission they'd pay their own sales team, because we extend their reach to enterprise buyers they'd otherwise need to find on their own. You don't pay more — in most cases, our clients get better pricing and terms than they would going direct, because we bring market intelligence and negotiating leverage from thousands of completed engagements. We earn ongoing compensation only when you stay on a solution, which means our incentive is your long-term satisfaction, not a one-time transaction.

  advisory_vs_broker: >
    Traditional technology brokers focus on procurement — they help you pick a vendor and move on. We stay with you. UPSTACK provides dedicated customer success managers and project managers who handle implementation, ongoing vendor coordination, trouble tickets, contract renewals, and strategic reviews. Our average client relationship is 3.5 years and growing. We're an extension of your IT team, not a matchmaker who disappears after the sale.

  advisory_vs_consultant: >
    Unlike traditional consulting firms that bill $200-500 per hour regardless of outcomes, UPSTACK only earns compensation when you move forward with a solution we recommend — and even then, the vendor pays us, not you. You get the same depth of expertise (our leadership team brings experience from RingCentral, 8x8, Oracle, AT&T, and other major platforms), plus implementation support and ongoing account management that most consultants don't provide. The difference is you're not paying for the advice — you're benefiting from it.

  engagement_model: >
    Working with UPSTACK typically starts with a discovery session where we map your current technology environment, contracts, and business objectives. From there, we build a tailored evaluation framework, run vendor comparisons using our proprietary data, and present scored recommendations. Most clients reach a vendor decision within 33 days on average — faster for networking, longer for complex CX transformations. If you decide to move forward, we manage implementation and stay on as your single point of contact for all vendor-related needs. The entire process costs you nothing, and there's never an obligation to act on our recommendations.

  lifecycle_value: >
    Our relationship doesn't end when you sign a contract. UPSTACK manages your vendor relationships on an ongoing basis — handling trouble tickets, tracking renewal timelines, flagging unused services, and identifying optimization opportunities as your business evolves. When it's time for a technology refresh or expansion, you already have a partner who understands your environment, your contracts, and your goals. That continuity is why our clients stay with us an average of 3.5 years — and why our NPS is 78.

  critical_contradictions:
    - id: "CONFLICT-001"
      claim: "99% client retention rate (UPSTACK homepage)"
      reality: "Internal cohort analysis shows 70-83% retention (2024 cohort: 83.15%, 2023: 74.60%, 2022: 69.64%, 2021: 70.93%)"
      impact: "HIGH — this is a client-facing claim that doesn't hold up against internal data"
      recommendation: >
        Three possible paths: (1) Identify and document the methodology that produces 99% — perhaps it measures something different like contract retention vs. account retention. (2) Retire the 99% claim and replace with defensible metrics like NPS 78, 3.5-year average tenure, or cohort-specific retention. (3) Investigate whether account deactivation vs. true churn is muddying the data. This needs resolution before any playbook uses the retention claim.

    - id: "CONFLICT-002"
      claim: "6,500+ customers (2023 Annual Report)"
      reality: "Salesforce shows 13,835 active client accounts"
      impact: "MEDIUM — different counting methodologies may explain gap"
      recommendation: >
        Likely explained by account vs. customer definition (one customer may have multiple accounts, or vice versa). Need to establish canonical customer count methodology. For playbooks, use whichever number has a defensible, documented methodology.

    - id: "CONFLICT-003"
      claim: "80 million data points (UPSTACK homepage)"
      reality: "Not verified against any internal data source"
      impact: "MEDIUM — if challenged by a sophisticated buyer, we need to explain what constitutes a 'data point'"
      recommendation: >
        Define what counts as a data point (quote line items? pricing records? transactional events?) and verify the count. If defensible, keep it. If not, switch to more concrete claims like "thousands of completed engagements" or the specific evaluation counts (5,759 in trailing 12 months).

      area: "Category mapping"
      finding: "'Data Center and Cloud' in Salesforce maps to both data_center_colocation and cloud_infrastructure, but they were separated using 'IT Operations' for cloud. This likely understates cloud and may overstate data center."
      impact: "Cloud infrastructure appears to be a very small category (38 evaluations) which probably doesn't reflect reality"
      recommendation: "Review Salesforce product_interest_c field values; consider splitting 'Data Center and Cloud' or adding subcategories"

    - id: "DQ-004"
      area: "Supplier category mapping"
      finding: "Top suppliers by deal volume are heavily networking-weighted. Enterprise-recognizable names (Equinix, Five9, etc.) appear in recognizable-supplier lists but may not be top by volume."
      impact: "Two supplier lists serve different purposes: volume leaders (Cato, LightEdge) vs. brand recognition leaders (AT&T, Equinix, Five9). Playbooks should use the right list for the right context."
      recommendation: "Maintain both lists explicitly"

    - id: "DQ-005"
      area: "Team credentials"
      finding: "No certification tracking system exists. Cannot aggregate CCNA, CCNP, CISSP, AWS, etc."
      impact: "Cannot make specific credential claims in client-facing materials"
      recommendation: "Implement team credential survey as immediate action. Can frame as 'investment in team documentation' rather than audit."

    - id: "DQ-006"
      area: "Implementation timeline"
      finding: "76-day average based on only 2% of projects (381 of 19,064) having complete date data"
      impact: "The number is real but the sample is thin"
      recommendation: "Enforce project date tracking in CX operations to strengthen this metric over time"

    - id: "DQ-007"
      area: "Client quotes"
      finding: "Only one verified client quote available (Sun Capital CTO). No systematic quote collection."
      impact: "Case studies lack social proof. Positioning lines can't be reinforced with client voice."
      recommendation: "Implement systematic quote collection during NPS/CSAT surveys and QBRs. Add 'permission to quote' field."

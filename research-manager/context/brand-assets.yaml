methodology:
  name: "UPSTACK Advisory Process"
  tagline: "Vendor-neutral technology advisory from evaluation through lifecycle management, at no cost to the client."
  steps:
    - name: "Discovery & Assessment"
      description: "Deep-dive into current technology environment, contracts, business requirements, and stakeholder priorities. We map your existing infrastructure, identify pain points, and align internal teams on evaluation criteria."
    - name: "Strategy & Solution Design"
      description: "Build requirements matrices, develop evaluation frameworks, and architect solutions across hundreds of vendors. We apply pricing intelligence from 80 million transactional data points to benchmark your current spend and identify optimization opportunities."
    - name: "Sourcing & Evaluation"
      description: "Manage the vendor evaluation process with data-driven scorecards informed by thousands of completed engagements. We run side-by-side comparisons, negotiate pricing and contract terms, and provide transparent recommendations tied to your specific requirements."
    - name: "Implementation & Deployment"
      description: "Dedicated project management through deployment. We coordinate across vendors, track milestones, manage escalations, and ensure solutions are delivered on time with minimal disruption to your operations."
    - name: "Lifecycle Management"
      description: "Ongoing vendor coordination, contract renewal management, trouble ticket resolution, and strategic account reviews. We serve as your single point of contact across all technology vendors, continuously optimizing your environment as your business evolves."
  description: "UPSTACK's advisory process takes enterprises from technology assessment through ongoing lifecycle management. Every recommendation is informed by real-world transactional data, delivered by experienced advisors, and backed by dedicated implementation and support teams. The entire engagement costs you nothing — our fees are reimbursed by the vendors you select."
  differentiators:
    - "Zero cost to the client — vendor-reimbursed model eliminates upfront fees and hourly billing"
    - "Vendor-neutral across hundreds of suppliers — no quotas, no exclusive relationships, no biased incentives"
    - "Pricing intelligence drawn from 80 million data points across thousands of transactional engagements"
    - "End-to-end engagement from evaluation through ongoing lifecycle management, not just procurement"
    - "Dedicated CX team with project managers and customer success managers assigned to every engagement"
    - "Proprietary technology platform for inventory management, price benchmarking, and vendor coordination"

    situation: "Sun Capital Partners, a growing investment firm, operated on an expensive and outdated MPLS network delivering just 100Mbps per location. Frequent service issues caused IT leaders to spend many late nights troubleshooting, and the network couldn't support expanding global operations across portfolio companies."
    approach: "UPSTACK conducted a deep requirements analysis and recommended a comprehensive migration to a global SD-WAN solution. The evaluation covered bandwidth, redundancy, diverse connections, and cost optimization — benchmarked against UPSTACK's transactional data."
    outcome: "The firm migrated to SD-WAN with increased bandwidth, redundant and diverse connections, and significant cost savings. The success of this engagement led to ongoing collaboration across multiple Sun Capital portfolio companies with tailored solutions for each."
    metrics:
      - "Upgraded from 100Mbps MPLS to higher-bandwidth SD-WAN across all locations"
      - "Achieved redundant, diverse connectivity eliminating single points of failure"

The company also wanted to redefine its customer journey mapping but didn't know where to start."

positioning_lines:
  vendor_neutral_intro: >
    We work with hundreds of technology vendors across data center, networking, cloud, security, and communications — but we don't represent any of them. We represent you. Our advisory team evaluates the full market against your specific requirements, using pricing intelligence from 80 million transactional data points to ensure you're getting the right solution at the right price. There are no quotas, no exclusive relationships, and no biased incentives influencing our recommendations.

  trust_model_explanation: >
    Our fees are reimbursed by the vendor you select — not by you. That sounds unusual, so here's why it works: vendors pay us the same commission they'd pay their own sales team, because we extend their reach to enterprise buyers they'd otherwise need to find on their own. You don't pay more — in most cases, our clients get better pricing and terms than they would going direct, because we bring market intelligence and negotiating leverage from thousands of completed engagements. We earn ongoing compensation only when you stay on a solution, which means our incentive is your long-term satisfaction, not a one-time transaction.

  advisory_vs_broker: >
    Traditional technology brokers focus on procurement — they help you pick a vendor and move on. We stay with you. UPSTACK provides dedicated customer success managers and project managers who handle implementation, ongoing vendor coordination, trouble tickets, contract renewals, and strategic reviews. We're an extension of your IT team, not a matchmaker who disappears after the sale.

  advisory_vs_consultant: >
    Unlike traditional consulting firms that bill $200-500 per hour regardless of outcomes, UPSTACK only earns compensation when you move forward with a solution we recommend — and even then, the vendor pays us, not you. You get the same depth of expertise (our leadership team brings experience from RingCentral, 8x8, Oracle, AT&T, and other major platforms), plus implementation support and ongoing account management that most consultants don't provide. The difference is you're not paying for the advice — you're benefiting from it.

  engagement_model: >
    Working with UPSTACK typically starts with a discovery session where we map your current technology environment, contracts, and business objectives. From there, we build a tailored evaluation framework, run vendor comparisons using our proprietary data, and present scored recommendations. If you decide to move forward, we manage implementation and stay on as your single point of contact for all vendor-related needs — from support tickets to contract renewals. The entire process costs you nothing, and there's never an obligation to act on our recommendations.

  lifecycle_value: >
    Our relationship doesn't end when you sign a contract. UPSTACK manages your vendor relationships on an ongoing basis — handling trouble tickets, tracking renewal timelines, flagging unused services, and identifying optimization opportunities as your business evolves. When it's time for a technology refresh or expansion, you already have a partner who understands your environment, your contracts, and your goals. That continuity is why our client retention rate is 99%.

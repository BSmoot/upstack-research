methodology:
  name: "UPSTACK Advisory Process"
  tagline: "Vendor-neutral technology advisory from evaluation through lifecycle management, at no cost to the client."
  steps:
    - name: "Discovery & Assessment"
      description: "Deep-dive into current technology environment, contracts, business requirements, and stakeholder priorities. We map your existing infrastructure, identify pain points, and align internal teams on evaluation criteria."
    - name: "Strategy & Solution Design"
      description: "Build requirements matrices, develop evaluation frameworks, and architect solutions across hundreds of vendors. We apply pricing intelligence from real-world transactional data to benchmark your current spend and identify optimization opportunities."
    - name: "Sourcing & Evaluation"
      description: "Manage the vendor evaluation process with data-driven scorecards informed by thousands of completed engagements. We run side-by-side comparisons, negotiate pricing and contract terms, and present scored recommendations tied to your specific requirements."
    - name: "Implementation & Deployment"
      description: "Dedicated project management through deployment. We coordinate across vendors, track milestones, manage escalations, and ensure solutions are delivered on time — averaging 76 days from selection to go-live."
    - name: "Lifecycle Management"
      description: "Ongoing vendor coordination, contract renewal management, trouble ticket resolution, and strategic account reviews. We serve as your single point of contact across all technology vendors, continuously optimizing your environment as your business evolves."
  description: "UPSTACK's advisory process takes enterprises from technology assessment through ongoing lifecycle management. Every recommendation is informed by real-world transactional data, delivered by experienced advisors, and backed by dedicated implementation and support teams. The entire engagement costs you nothing — our fees are reimbursed by the vendors you select."
  differentiators:
    # EDIT (Issue 2): "vendor-reimbursed" → "vendor-funded" to match language standard
    - "Zero cost to the client — vendor-funded model eliminates upfront fees and hourly billing"
    - "Vendor-neutral across 300+ suppliers — no quotas, no exclusive relationships, no biased incentives"
    - "Data-driven evaluation using transactional intelligence from thousands of completed engagements"
    - "End-to-end engagement from evaluation through ongoing lifecycle management, not just procurement"
    - "Dedicated CX team with project managers and customer success managers assigned to every engagement"
    - "Proprietary technology platform for inventory management, price benchmarking, and vendor coordination"
    - "Average 33-day evaluation-to-decision cycle — 12 days for networking, under 90 days even for complex CX transformations"

proof_points:

positioning_lines:
  vendor_neutral_intro: >
    We work with over 300 technology vendors across data center, networking, cloud, security, and communications — but we don't represent any of them. We represent you. Our advisory team evaluates the full market against your specific requirements, using pricing intelligence from thousands of completed engagements to ensure you're getting the right solution at the right price. There are no quotas, no exclusive relationships, and no biased incentives influencing our recommendations.

  trust_model_explanation: >
    Our fees are reimbursed by the vendor you select — not by you. That sounds unusual, so here's why it works: vendors pay us the same commission they'd pay their own sales team, because we extend their reach to enterprise buyers they'd otherwise need to find on their own. You don't pay more — in most cases, our clients get better pricing and terms than they would going direct, because we bring market intelligence and negotiating leverage from thousands of completed engagements. We earn ongoing compensation only when you stay on a solution, which means our incentive is your long-term satisfaction, not a one-time transaction.

  advisory_vs_broker: >
    Traditional technology brokers focus on procurement — they help you pick a vendor and move on. We stay with you. UPSTACK provides dedicated customer success managers and project managers who handle implementation, ongoing vendor coordination, trouble tickets, contract renewals, and strategic reviews. Our average client relationship is 3.5 years and growing. We're an extension of your IT team, not a matchmaker who disappears after the sale.

  advisory_vs_consultant: >
    Unlike traditional consulting firms that bill $200-500 per hour regardless of outcomes, UPSTACK only earns compensation when you move forward with a solution we recommend — and even then, the vendor pays us, not you. You get the same depth of expertise (our leadership team brings experience from RingCentral, 8x8, Oracle, AT&T, and other major platforms), plus implementation support and ongoing account management that most consultants don't provide. The difference is you're not paying for the advice — you're benefiting from it.

  engagement_model: >
    Working with UPSTACK typically starts with a discovery session where we map your current technology environment, contracts, and business objectives. From there, we build a tailored evaluation framework, run vendor comparisons using our proprietary data, and present scored recommendations. Most clients reach a vendor decision within 33 days on average — faster for networking, longer for complex CX transformations. If you decide to move forward, we manage implementation and stay on as your single point of contact for all vendor-related needs. The entire process costs you nothing, and there's never an obligation to act on our recommendations.

  lifecycle_value: >
    Our relationship doesn't end when you sign a contract. UPSTACK manages your vendor relationships on an ongoing basis — handling trouble tickets, tracking renewal timelines, flagging unused services, and identifying optimization opportunities as your business evolves. When it's time for a technology refresh or expansion, you already have a partner who understands your environment, your contracts, and your goals. That continuity is why our client retention is 99.8%, our average relationship is 3.5 years and growing, and our NPS is 78.

    revenue_model_note: >
      UPSTACK earns commission from the vendors clients select. This is the honest

      reason: "Established standard language; 'free' undersells the model"

    - term: "vendor certification program"
      use_instead: null
      reason: "UPSTACK does not certify vendors; it evaluates them via transactional intelligence"

    # EDIT (Issue 2): Added to prevent "vendor-reimbursed" from propagating
    - term: "vendor-reimbursed"
      use_instead: "vendor-funded"
      reason: "Standardization — 'vendor-funded' is the controlled term per language standard. 'Reimbursed' is acceptable in explanatory prose (e.g., 'our fees are reimbursed by the vendor') but not as a model label."

  positioning_guidance:
    category_first: >
      Lead with the unmanaged problem (vendor lifecycle without portfolio-level oversight),
      not with UPSTACK's capabilities. Category creation positioning expands the market by
      making buyers realize they have an unmanaged problem, rather than competing within the
      existing advisory market for the small percentage of buyers already looking.

    structural_alignment: >
      Financial services is structurally aligned with UPSTACK's strengths because
      regulatory pressure creates permanent advisory dependency. Unlike industries
      where technology advisory is episodic, financial services institutions face
      continuous compliance obligations that require ongoing vendor evaluation,
      contract management, and technology lifecycle oversight.

  critical_contradictions:
    - id: "RESOLVED-001"
      claim: "99% client retention rate (UPSTACK homepage)"
      resolution: "CONFIRMED ACCURATE. Retention is 99.8% when measured on revenue-generating customers (3,064 accounts with active MRC). The apparent discrepancy arose because 75% of 'customer' accounts in Salesforce (22,786 total) are non-revenue records — locations, prospects, inactive accounts. Cohort-level retention: 2020: 99.8%, 2021: 100%, 2022: 99.8%, 2023: 99.8%, 2024: 100%, 2025: 98.9% (still ramping). Average MRC per active customer: $6,255."
      impact: "RESOLVED — claim is defensible with documented methodology"
      action: "Use in playbooks with confidence. If challenged, explain: measured on revenue-generating customers, not the broader account database."

    - id: "RESOLVED-002"
      claim: "6,500+ customers (2023 Annual Report) vs. 13,835 accounts in Salesforce"
      resolution: "Database contains ~22,786 total 'customer' accounts. Of these, 5,399 are active revenue-generating customers (accounts with active MRC > 0). Breakdown: 2,307 pre-2020 legacy clients (avg $15.7K MRC, $36.2M total MRR), 3,058 from 2020-2025 cohorts (avg $6.2K MRC, $18.8M total MRR), and 34 undated. The '6,500+' figure from the 2023 Annual Report likely included some accounts that have since gone inactive. The remaining ~17,000 records are locations, prospects, and inactive accounts."
      impact: "RESOLVED — use '5,000+ active clients' as defensible external figure"
      action: "Use 5,399 (or rounded to '5,000+') for client count. Pre-2020 legacy customer base is a strength worth highlighting: these long-tenure, high-value relationships represent the durability of the advisory model."

    - id: "CONFLICT-003"
      claim: "80 million data points (UPSTACK homepage)"
      reality: "Not verified against any internal data source"
      impact: "MEDIUM — if challenged by a sophisticated buyer, we need to explain what constitutes a 'data point'"
      recommendation: >
        Define what counts as a data point (quote line items? pricing records? transactional events?) and verify the count. If defensible, keep it. If not, switch to more concrete claims like "thousands of completed engagements" or the specific evaluation counts (5,759 in trailing 12 months).

  data_quality_observations:
    - id: "DQ-001"
      area: "Industry tagging"
      finding: "6,618 accounts (of 13,835) have null industry tags — 48% untagged"
      impact: "Vertical metrics are directionally correct but incomplete"
      recommendation: "Program 04 data governance should prioritize industry tag backfill"

    - id: "DQ-002"
      area: "Category mapping"
      finding: "'Data Center and Cloud' in Salesforce maps to both data_center_colocation and cloud_infrastructure, but they were separated using 'IT Operations' for cloud. This likely understates cloud and may overstate data center."
      impact: "Cloud infrastructure appears to be a very small category (38 evaluations) which probably doesn't reflect reality"
      recommendation: "Review Salesforce product_interest_c field values; consider splitting 'Data Center and Cloud' or adding subcategories"

    - id: "DQ-003"
      area: "Cost savings tracking"
      finding: "Cost savings calculated from quote line item MRC deltas — only available when both prior and new pricing exist. Available for 1,709 networking deals but only 3 security deals."
      impact: "The headline '35% average cost reduction' is heavily weighted by networking. Category-specific savings claims need sample size qualifiers."
      recommendation: "Implement incumbent pricing capture during discovery phase as standard process"

    - id: "DQ-004"
      area: "Supplier category mapping"
      finding: "Top suppliers by deal volume are heavily networking-weighted. Enterprise-recognizable names (Equinix, Five9, etc.) appear in recognizable-supplier lists but may not be top by volume."
      impact: "Two supplier lists serve different purposes: volume leaders (Cato, LightEdge) vs. brand recognition leaders (AT&T, Equinix, Five9). Playbooks should use the right list for the right context."
      recommendation: "Maintain both lists explicitly"

    - id: "DQ-005"
      area: "Team credentials"
      finding: "No certification tracking system exists. Cannot aggregate CCNA, CCNP, CISSP, AWS, etc."
      impact: "Cannot make specific credential claims in client-facing materials"
      recommendation: "Implement team credential survey as immediate action. Can frame as 'investment in team documentation' rather than audit."

    - id: "DQ-006"
      area: "Implementation timeline"
      finding: "76-day average based on only 2% of projects (381 of 19,064) having complete date data"
      impact: "The number is real but the sample is thin"
      recommendation: "Enforce project date tracking in CX operations to strengthen this metric over time"

    - id: "DQ-007"
      area: "Client quotes"
      finding: "Only one verified client quote available (Sun Capital CTO). No systematic quote collection."
      impact: "Case studies lack social proof. Positioning lines can't be reinforced with client voice."
      recommendation: "Implement systematic quote collection during NPS/CSAT surveys and QBRs. Add 'permission to quote' field."

  remaining_gaps:
    - "Gross and net revenue retention rates — requires cohort revenue tracking not currently in place"
    - "Revenue CAGR — historical revenue data in Salesforce is inconsistent"
    - "Industry benchmark comparisons — no external benchmark data captured"
    - "Client quotes beyond Sun Capital CTO — no systematic collection"
    - "HIPAA/BAA capability documentation"
    - "Formal compliance program documentation for healthcare and financial services"
    - "Supplier compliance certification tracking (which partners have SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI DSS, FedRAMP)"
    - "Team certification and experience aggregates"

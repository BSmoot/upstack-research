## BUYER DISCOVERY PATTERNS
### How Buyers Find, Research, and Evaluate Network & Connectivity Solutions

### Primary Pain Points Triggering Evaluation

Some organizations are simply getting less than they require in terms of bandwidth, reliability, security and problem resolution. A thorough evaluation of your internet connectivity is the first step toward addressing these issues, and should answer the following questions: Do you have enough internet bandwidth to support critical applications? Are employees able to be fully productive without undue delays and downtime? As your organization evolves, can your Internet Service Provider (ISP) consistently deliver the services you require to all your locations?

A recent report by Cloudbrink reveals that work-from-anywhere (WFA) employees are extending their work hours beyond the traditional eight-hour day. Data usage spikes on Fridays, suggesting that WFA employees work longer hours compared to their "9 to 5" counterparts, with significant activity from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Despite concerns about employee focus, the report finds that remote workers are highly productive, though they could achieve even more if technical challenges were minimized.

## EVALUATION CRITERIA FRAMEWORK
### Ranked by Importance to Buyers

### Tier 1 (Critical Must-Haves):

1. **Reliability & Uptime SLAs**
   - Service Level Agreements for availability (99.9%-99.999%)
   -

A service level agreement or SLA is a contract with your ISP that guarantees the availability of your network (in terms of 99%-plus uptime) and the connection quality of your circuit (in terms of packet loss, jitter, latency, and Mean Time to Respond or MTTR). It's important to note that, no matter how high your SLA percentage is, downtime will inevitably still occur at some point during the life of your contract. When your SLA is broken (aka downtime occurs), you will be compensated via service credits — which is a huge benefit and differentiator of dedicated internet circuits.

2. **Performance & Bandwidth**
   - Guaranteed symmetrical speeds
   - Low latency, minimal jitter & packet loss
   -

If you purchase a 100 Mbps DIA circuit, you are guaranteed to receive 100 Mbps of bandwidth 100% of the time. Compare this with a 100 Mbps "shared" connection where 100 Mbps is likely the network's provisioned peak speed and actual speed is typically much lower.

3. **Security & Compliance**
   - Built-in encryption
   - Zero-trust capabilities
   - Compliance with HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR requirements
   -

MPLS provides private connections but lacks built-in encryption. SD-WAN integrates encrypted tunnels and cloud-delivered security, making it better suited for dynamic, security-focused environments.

4. **Support & Responsiveness**
   - 24/7/365 U.S.-based support
   - Fast MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)
   -

Organizations should seek a single provider that delivers 24/7/365 U.S.-based support and is capable of resolving connectivity problems in just a few hours.

### Tier 2 (Important Differentiators):

5. **Cost (TCO - Total Cost of Ownership)**
   -

MPLS typically has higher setup and operational costs because it requires dedicated circuits and specialized equipment. SD-WAN, on the other hand, leverages existing and more cost-efficient internet connections, reducing expenses.
   -

Broadband delivers cost savings of 60% to 70% when compared to T1 and other MPLS transport options.

6. **Scalability & Flexibility**
   - Ability to add locations quickly
   - Support for multi-cloud connectivity
   -

Organizations in growth mode need networking solutions that can grow with them. SD-WAN offers significant advantages in scalability and flexibility, allowing businesses to easily add new locations or support remote workforces without major infrastructure changes. It's best to plan for future growth, considering how cost-effectively your network can scale with wide area networks rather than MPLS.

7. **Cloud Integration & Multi-Cloud Support**
   - Native cloud direct connect capabilities
   - Easy integration with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
   -

SD-WAN integrates more easily with the cloud. Connecting to the cloud via MPLS is a specialized service offered by some MPLS service providers for some cloud providers. With MPLS, connecting with the cloud requires constructing a direct route to that cloud provider's infrastructure.

8. **Management & Automation**
   - Centralized visibility and control
   - AI-driven automation capabilities
   -

Critical features offered by SD-WAN Solutions include: Application Awareness: Prioritizes critical business applications for optimal performance. Centralized Management: Provides a single interface for easy configuration and monitoring. Network Security: Includes integrated security measures to protect against threats. Scalability: Supports seamless expansion to accommodate growing business needs.

### Tier 3 (Nice-to-Haves & Differentiators):

9. **Vendor Consolidation & Single-Pane-of-Glass Management**
   - Integrated networking + security
   - SASE capabilities
   -

In 2025, 54% of adopters reported stronger security, 52% reported easier management, and nearly half reported better performance and cost reduction as benefits of switching to SASE.

10. **Geographic Footprint & Network Coverage**
    -

Their available speeds are nearly identical, ranging from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps, though Verizon has a much larger network with 900,000 fiber route miles compared to Lumen's 340,000.

11. **Redundancy & Failover Capabilities**
    - Automatic failover between connectivity types
    - Diverse routing options

## MARKET DYNAMICS ANALYSIS
### Trends, Pressures, and Market Shifts

### 1. AI Integration Transforming Network Operations

The integration of artificial intelligence into network operations has moved from innovative to essential. Organizations are increasingly deploying AI-driven solutions for various operational needs.

Network automation is imperative, and enterprises are looking to augment their traditional automation technologies, such as scripting, machine learning, and robotic process automation, with generative AI-driven capabilities that can make automation easier to deploy, more capable, and more adaptable. According to an Enterprise Strategy Group survey of 400 networking professionals released in late November, 93% feel that network automation will be essential for keeping up with change — and 89% say that networking is becoming increasingly important as a result of AI. In particular, respondents are looking for proactive outage prevention, predictive maintenance, automated discovery of vulnerabilities and policy violations, reduced human error, and better visibility across hybrid networks.

### 2. Hybrid Work Remains Permanent, Driving Connectivity Demand

Most want about two to three remote days per week, what the OECD calls the "hybrid sweet spot." Gallup's 2025 data backs it up: satisfaction peaks when employees spend roughly three days in the office and two at home. It's balance, not distance, that people are asking for. For all the debates about remote versus office work, the numbers on hybrid productivity are consistent and strong: 84% of employees say they get more done outside the office.

The top challenge, according to survey respondents, is maintaining a steady connection.

A full 90% of employees see value in collaboration tools. However, only 32% of employers are investing in the high-grade collaboration technology that supports flexible, hybrid work models. At the same time, AI is driving a revolution in the workplace (wherever it may be). Yet only 44% of employers are investing in it. Organizations that invest in the networking, security, AI, and collaboration foundation to adequately support this future hybrid workforce will draw top talent and stay competitive. Their workers will be both more flexible and productive.

### 3. Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) Disrupting Fiber Economics

Estimated service provider revenues from Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) worldwide of USD 27 billion in 2022 are projected to reach USD 67 billion by 2028, a CAGR of 16 percent. The growth potential from FWA is especially attractive as it leverages mobile broadband assets to a large degree. High-speed mobile broadband coverage of 4G and 5G has opened up opportunities for service providers to deliver broadband services to homes and small and medium-siz.

Businesses, especially in underserved or remote areas, have an increasing demand for reliable and high-speed internet connectivity to support their operations, such as cloud computing, video conferencing, and data transfer. Fixed wireless solutions can provide broadband internet access where traditional wired infrastructure is unavailable or cost-prohibitive.

### 4. Single-Vendor Consolidation Trend

Single-vendor deployments are expected to account for 90% of the market by 2029. This is reshaping buyer decision-making toward integrated solutions that combine networking, security, and management capabilities.

### 5. Cloud Connectivity Becoming Strategic Imperative

According to a TechTarget Enterprise Strategy Group survey, 94% of organizations work with multiple cloud providers—some choosing different providers for specific capabilities, while others make these choices based on merger and acquisition considerations.

By 2031, the global market size of multi-cloud networking is projected to reach $19.9 billion USD (£15.7 billion) and grow at a rate of 23.3%. Businesses that embrace multi-cloud networking and environments will find themselves connecting and managing workloads across diverse cloud environments and establishing a secure, high-performance network that will carry out operations as efficiently as possible.

### 6. Compliance & Security Regulatory Pressures

Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS mandate training to prevent costly breaches and legal penalties.

Hybrid work increases cybersecurity risks due to less secure home networks, the use of personal devices, and a greater reliance on cloud services. With the expansion of hybrid work, compliance with data privacy regulations has become more complex.

### 7. Zero-Trust & SASE Architecture Gaining Mainstream Adoption

With remote work firmly established as a permanent fixture, organizations are accelerating their adoption of zero-trust security frameworks. This approach, which assumes no implicit trust and requires continuous verification, is becoming more sophisticated and comprehensive in its implementation.

## RESEARCH GAPS & CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

### High Confidence Areas (80-95%):
- ✅ **Buyer pain points and triggers** - Well documented across multiple enterprise sources
- ✅ **SD-WAN vs MPLS evaluation criteria** - Extensive technical and business comparisons
- ✅ **Carrier positioning (AT&T, Verizon, Lumen)** - Quarterly earnings and analyst coverage
- ✅ **Gartner/analyst influence** - Widely cited in buyer research
- ✅ **Hybrid work driving demand** - Consistent data across multiple surveys
- ✅ **AI/automation as emerging priority** - Clear trend in 2025 analyst reports

### Medium Confidence Areas (60-80%):
- ⚠️ **Cato Networks vs Fortinet competitive dynamics** - Strong reviews but smaller sample sizes on some metrics
- ⚠️ **Fixed wireless business adoption** - Early-stage market with limited case studies
- ⚠️ **Cloud direct connect buyer motivation** - Emerging category, less buyer research data
- ⚠️ **Mid-market buyer behavior specifics** - Most available data skews enterprise (1000+ employees)
- ⚠️ **ROI calculations used by buyers** - Limited public data on internal evaluation frameworks

### Lower Confidence Areas (40-60%):
- ❓ **Comcast Business/Spectrum Enterprise buyer perception** - Less available analyst coverage
- ❓ **Regional carrier evaluation criteria** - Limited research outside major metro markets
- ❓ **Implementation challenges/post-purchase pain** - Primarily vendor-provided case studies
- ❓ **Specific contract negotiation tactics** - Proprietary information rarely disclosed
- ❓ **Buyer willingness to switch suppliers** - Limited churn data available publicly

### Data Gaps & Recommendations:

1. **Need: Mid-market buyer behavior specifics** - Most research skews enterprise; 100-500 employee companies under-researched

2. **Need: Regional carrier evaluation matrices** - Limited data on how smaller/regional providers compete

3. **Need: Implementation timeline data** - Beyond carrier estimates; actual customer deployment timelines needed

4. **Need: Contract term trends** - How are multi-year terms negotiated? What's the shift away from 36-month commitments?

5. **Need: Buyer satisfaction longitudinal data** - How do post-purchase satisfaction ratings compare 12-24 months after implementation?

6. **Recommendation: Conduct buyer interviews** - 10-15 interviews with IT decision-makers at 100-1000 employee companies would fill gaps on:
   - Actual evaluation criteria weighting
   - How competitive information flows internally
   - Post-purchase implementation challenges
   - ROI measurement methodologies

7. **Recommendation: Analyze Gartner peer review data** - Download full review text to extract buyer quote patterns and common objections/concerns

8. **Recommendation: Track LinkedIn conversation** - Monitor Network Engineer and IT Manager groups for organic (unpaid) discussion of provider comparisons

## CONCLUSION

The Network & Connectivity category is undergoing significant transformation driven by **hybrid work permanence, cloud-first architecture adoption, AI-driven automation expectations, and FWA disruption**.

**Key buyer insights:**
- Reliability and performance still dominate evaluation, but **cost and agility are closely tied** for decision-making
- **SD-WAN adoption is accelerating** as organizations move away from expensive MPLS
- **Single-vendor consolidation** (SASE platforms) is a significant trend, with **90% of deployments expected to be single-vendor by 2029**
- **Compliance and security** are constant evaluation drivers, especially in regulated industries
- **Peer reviews (Gartner Peer Insights, PeerSpot)** carry higher buyer influence than vendor marketing

**Supplier dynamics:**
- Mega-carriers (AT&T, Verizon, Lumen) maintain market power through scale and geographic coverage
- **Fortinet maintains SD-WAN market leadership** with highest customer review volume across platforms
- **Cato Networks is the rising challenger** in cloud-native SASE with strong adoption among cloud-first enterprises
- **Channel shift accelerating** - carriers pivoting to indirect distribution (70% target for Lumen by 2030)

**Market opportunities:**
- **5G FWA adoption** is creating alternative to fiber, particularly in underserved markets
- **AI-driven network automation** is shifting from "nice-to-have" to "must-have" in buyer evaluation
- **Multi-cloud connectivity** is becoming a primary procurement driver
- **Compliance regulatory pressure** (HIPAA 2025 updates, DORA, PCI DSS 4.0) creating continuous buying cycles

This category continues to mature, with **clear vendor leaders emerging, buyer evaluation criteria becoming more sophisticated, and market consolidation accelerating**.

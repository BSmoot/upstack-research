# CHANNEL & COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
## Infrastructure Advisory Market Competitive Landscape

**Research Date:** February 14, 2026
**Focus:** Vendor Direct Sales (PRIMARY Competition) & Advisory Competitive Landscape

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research reveals a market in structural transformation. The infrastructure advisory market is experiencing explosive consolidation among advisory firms (Avant, Telarus, Bluewave, AppDirect securing $750M+ in PE funding) while **direct vendor sales remain the primary competitive threat**.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Primary Competition = Direct Vendor Sales**:

Lumen intends for 70% of its business to run through partners over the next 5-10 years, while Verizon's indirect distribution grew from single-digit to "healthy into the double-digits" of business, yet they maintain dominant direct sales forces.

2. **Market Growth**:

Information Technology Consulting Services Market is projected to grow from 619.32 USD Billion in 2025 to 850.0 USD Billion by 2035, at a CAGR of 3.22%, with faster growth in specialized areas like vendor selection and lifecycle management.

3. **Advisory Consolidation**:

Only 20% of technology buyers acquired services from "the Channel" a few years ago, with projections that this number will flip to nearly 80%, while Private Equity has arrived in force.

4. **Vendor Lock-In as Primary Competitive Tactic**: Major vendors use direct sales, exclusive assessments, marketplace dynamics, and financial incentives to bypass advisors entirely.

## SUPPLIER DIRECT SALES ANALYSIS (PRIMARY COMPETITION)

### How Major Vendors Sell Directly

#### **Network/Connectivity Vendors**

**AT&T, Verizon, Lumen Direct Sales Motion:**

Lumen targets 70% channel revenue growth over 5-10 years, while Verizon's indirect channel grew from single-digit to "healthy into the double-digits" of business. However,

many of the largest carriers conduct a large portion of their sales through their own direct force, and in some cases direct sales revenue dwarfs what the channel produces.

**Direct Sales Tactics:**
- Dedicated enterprise account teams with deep customer relationships

Lumen secured $8.5 billion in AI-driven networking contracts with hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google Cloud, Meta), using direct sales to enterprise and hyperscaler segments
- Complex RFP-to-MSA processes managed by in-house teams
- SLA negotiations and implementation oversight by vendor employees

**Vendor-Specific Positioning:**

AT&T has strong reputation for customer satisfaction, backed by multiple J.D. Power awards for its service to large enterprise customers

Verizon Business operates its own extensive wireless network offering 5G and LTE, while Lumen takes a multi-carrier approach with EWAS (Enterprise Wireless Access Service) using 4G LTE and 5G from T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T

---

#### **Security Vendors**

**Palo Alto Networks Direct Sales Motion:**

Palo Alto Networks employs a robust sales channel strategy heavily relying on indirect sales through comprehensive partner networks, augmented by direct sales targeting major enterprise and government clients.

**Channel Conflict Strategy:**

Channel sales grew by 15.9% year-on-year outpacing direct sales, with channel sales making up 90.6% of overall market, while direct sales made up 9.4%

Palo Alto's NextWave Partner Program offers comprehensive support including technical assistance, authorized professional services, and extensive training/certification, with generous incentives including front-end discounts, deal registration incentives, and back-end rebates

Palo Alto is moving its partner ecosystem toward next-gen security, annual recurring revenue, and deeper focus on services, with partners delivering more consulting, managed, and implementation services, with the revamped program rolling out after August

**Zscaler Direct Sales Motion:**

Zscaler primarily relies on a direct sales force to engage with enterprise and public sector clients, allowing for in-depth customer interactions and tailoring of security solutions, with focus on direct sales as a core strategy.

Zscaler is looking beyond the channel, adopting a "partner ecosystem" approach, evolving from bidirectional to multidimensional relationships with partners

2025 will see Zscaler aligning its partners more closely to its direct sales organization "to make sure that we have a perfect fit," creating a single SKU for ecosystem approaches with technology alliances like CrowdStrike, AWS, and Okta

**CrowdStrike Direct Sales:**

CrowdStrike bet on endpoint consolidation and single-agent architecture, with the Falcon platform handling endpoints, cloud workloads, and identity in one package, simplifying operations and creating pricing leverage

- Direct sales force focused on platform consolidation narrative (move away from point products)

---

#### **Contact Center/CX Vendors**

**Genesys vs. Five9 vs. NICE Direct Sales Strategies:**

Genesys, NICE, Five9, and Amazon Connect all look similar on a feature grid, promising omnichannel, AI, and "enterprise-grade" reliability.

**Positioning Against Advisors:**

Platforms like Genesys, NICE, and Five9 are proprietary software suites with curated application marketplaces and rigid, per-seat licensing models, contrasting with the perceived safety of an all-in-one suite from vendors versus strategic power of open, consumption-based models

Genesys has better suite of digital engagement tools than Five9, with advanced AI chatbots and shines in incoming call management and intelligent virtual agent offerings

- Direct sales teams emphasize "platform consolidation" as anti-advisor narrative (why work with an advisor when you can standardize on one vendor?)

**Free Assessments & Advisory Services:**

One Genesys customer stated "Genesys Cloud was the only product architected for the cloud from the ground up, designed with an API first approach and including a comprehensive set of features, with competitors relying on other vendors to round out their service offering"

—vendors position their own "strategic consulting" as superior to third-party advisors.

---

#### **Cloud Vendors (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)**

**Direct Sales + Marketplace Model:**

AWS, Azure and Google Cloud marketplaces will reach $163 billion by 2030, up from $30 billion in 2024, with a five-year CAGR of 29.1% from 2025 to 2030.

**How They Compete Against Advisors:**

Cloud service providers (CSPs) don't pay direct commissions to indirect sellers, so partners need to be smart if they're going to take advantage of the rush to the cloud

AWS Marketplace's channel partner ecosystem simplifies software sales while maximizing impact, seamlessly connecting buyers, ISVs, and consulting/channel partners to reduce friction, with the CPPO model empowering ISVs to authorize channel partners with wholesale pricing access while allowing partners to maintain financial and contractual relationships with customers directly

Azure's Multiparty Private Offers empower ISVs to scale and establish recurring revenue through channel partnerships, enabling ISVs and partners to jointly create tailored offers with flexible payouts

**Lock-In Strategy:**
- Consumption-based pricing tied to cloud commitments

Cloud commitments across the big three hyperscalers total $470 billion, with customers allowed to spend portions on third-party marketplace purchases, with accelerating pace shown by nearly $30 billion of new commitments added in Q2 2025 alone, and analysts noting customers are moving from opportunistically using marketplace purchases to strategic marketplace procurement

- Built-in ecosystem advantage (fewer integration steps, native support)

---

### Vendor Positioning Against Advisors (Objection Handling)

#### **How Vendors Discourage Advisor Use:**

1. **"We Provide Strategic Consulting for Free"**
   -

Vendors emphasize platform-first architecture positioning, claiming advisors create unnecessary complexity by recommending "best-of-breed" point solutions


2. **Lock-In Through Pricing & Exclusivity**
   -

Palo Alto's partner program features front-end discounts, deal registration incentives, and back-end rebates, including "Partner Perks" that provide individual financial rewards to sales reps and engineers, creating direct incentives not to work with advisors


3. **Channel Conflict Strategy**
   -

"Channel conflict" occurs when the channel partner and direct seller of the same vendor compete for the same customer, particularly common in the advisor/agent channel, and partners often report that direct sales teams disintermediate them at renewal time

4. **Marketplace Advantage**
   -

Hyperscalers are competing to win as a channel for agentic AI through agent marketplaces, with cybersecurity representing high-growth area where spending will reach $31 billion by 2030 with 31% CAGR, and integrated security platforms becoming essential

---

### Exclusive Incentives to Go Direct

1. **Volume Commitments & Rebates**: Multi-tier discounts for committed spend
2. **Deal Registration**: Vendors guarantee non-competitive selling if account is "registered"
3. **Partner Perks**: Individual compensation for sales/technical staff (bypasses advisor fees)
4. **Private Offers on Marketplaces**:

AWS standardized and reduced many listing fees in January 2024, with SaaS/public offers at 3%, private-offer listing fees scaling by TCV (3% / 2% / 1.5%), renewals at 1.5%, and CPPO (channel partner private offer) adding +0.5%

5. **Free Tools & Assessments**: Built-in evaluation capability (no need for advisors)

---

## ADVISORY COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Major Advisory Players & Market Position

#### **Tier 1: Master Agents / Technology Sourcing Distributors (TSDs)**

**Telarus:**

Datamob was the top overall partner for cloud and managed services and sold the largest deal in that category; Bluewave scored the best for networking and landed the largest networking deal

Lumen led the way with the most overall revenue, followed by AT&T and Comcast Business

 (among Telarus partners)

**AVANT (backed by Pamlico Capital):**

Avant raised $200M in funding

- Recently acquired PlanetOne to consolidate market position

**Bluewave Technology Group:**

Bluewave grabbed $75M in funding

- Positioned as premium advisory for mid-market to enterprise (case study: $20M savings for multistate retailer on cloud migration)

**Intelisys (acquired by ScanSource):**

Intelisys had $120M in top line revenue and was acquired for $83.6M upfront and earn out of $100M to $150M – max of $233.6M

**AppDirect / AppSmart:**

AppDirect, parent of AppSmart, raised $465M including $185M for App Invest

**UPSTACK:**

Upstack got $50M plus $100M in debt equity

- Positioned as direct advisor (vendor-reimbursed model, similar to UPSTACK's own positioning)

#### **Tier 2: Smaller Regional Advisors**

Telarus' top 14 competitors are TBI, Sandler Partners, Intelisys, PlanetOne, Sybran, MicroCorp, ipnordic, X4 Solutions, Breakthrough Technology Group, WTG, Quantum Networks, LLC, Audience, Avant and Telegration.

---

### How Advisors Compete Against Each Other

1. **Vendor Relationships & Commissions**: Control over which vendors they can quote (Telarus, Intelisys have exclusive relationships with major carriers)
2. **Vertical Specialization**: Some focus on healthcare, financial services, retail
3. **Regional Footprint**: Geographic advantage (Bluewave strong in specific regions)
4. **Technology Platform**: Proprietary tools, integration capabilities
5. **Brand & Reputation**: Customer service reputation (Telarus recognized as top-tier)

---

### Competitive Positioning: How Advisors Differentiate

Technology advisors are competing against global systems integrators for large enterprise accounts on a regular basis — and winning, with tech advisors touted for their ability to move out of the midmarket and out-consult the world's largest global systems integrators, and advisors sharing how they've won in enterprise accounts despite their small size, with cross-selling helping partners widen their accounts in SMB and midmarket segments.

**Specific Differentiation Tactics:**

1. **Speed to Market**:

Advisors approach accounts faster than GSIs; in one case, customer was looking to pay six figures to a GSI for cloud migration strategy, but Bluewave and Telarus discovered the deeper business need, concluded Azure migration couldn't happen within time frame and budget, and advised managed private cloud instead, saving customer close to $20 million by avoiding steep penalties, lowering operating costs, and eliminating unnecessary applications

2. **Bespoke Solutions Over Platform Standardization**:

For enterprise deals, flexibility to create bespoke offerings makes the difference; customers want the ability to customize a solution and build it around their environment, with advisors leveraging engineering teams to work with customer base to design custom solutions

3. **Results-Focused Positioning**:

World Telecom Partners CEO stated he's able to deliver ground-level outcomes that differentiate from GSIs, focused on delivering results within the business rather than overall strategy, enabling organizations to accelerate technology buying decisions through partnerships, research, extensive engineering, project management and ongoing support throughout the service life cycle

4. **Ongoing Vendor Management**: Unlike GSIs who hand off post-implementation, advisors manage the vendor relationship long-term

---

## MARKET GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES

### Where Vendors Fail to Serve Buyers Well

1. **Biased Recommendations**: Vendors can only recommend their own solutions, creating vendor lock-in

2. **Post-Implementation Abandonment**:

Telecom expense management (TEM) is reactive, focusing on invoice auditing and catching billing errors after they happen, while vendor management is proactive, starting earlier in the lifecycle and following relationships through to performance tracking, escalation support, and contract renegotiation—preventing mistakes rather than cleaning them up

3. **Complex Technology Evaluation**:

Nearly half of IT projects fail due to poor vendor performance or misalignment with business objectives, which is not just a technical problem but a strategic one, making smarter vendor selection essential, as choosing the wrong partner costs more than money—it can derail business goals

4. **Vendor Lock-In Complexity**:
   -

Vendor diversification fosters competitive vendor management, offering opportunities for negotiating improved pricing, flexible contract terms, and better support models, with dynamic procurement environment incentivizing innovation and performance to achieve balanced total cost of ownership

   - Advisors can help navigate multi-vendor environments; vendors want single-vendor standardization

5. **Unmanaged Vendor Lifecycle**:
   -

Most IT and ops teams are juggling dozens of vendors, outdated contracts, and SLA commitments that no one's tracking, with this core problem leading to vendor management operations suffering from spreadsheets, outdated contracts, and networks of unmonitored vendors, leaving teams in permanent firefighting mode

---

### Market Opportunities for Infrastructure Advisory

1. **AI-Driven Infrastructure Selection**: As AI workload demand explodes, advisors can position as navigators through vendor options (AWS, Azure, hyperscaler fiber plays)

2. **Multi-Cloud / Hybrid Complexity**:

Many organizations run multi-cloud or hybrid setups to reduce risk, meet compliance needs, or use best-of-breed services, though this creates added complexity in management, security, and cost tracking

—advisors fill this gap

3. **Post-Implementation Vendor Management**: None of the major vendors offer ongoing vendor relationship management—this is pure advisory opportunity

4. **Cost Optimization Through Competitive Procurement**:

Example: 100 Mbps circuit still billing at $800/month when current market rate is $400, because without regular rate checks and re-shopping, pricing gets stale fast across every line item and every site

5. **Strategic Vendor Negotiation**:

Technology Advisors prevent costly mistakes, eliminate vendor lock-ins, and ensure technology investments drive business growth, helping understand correct budget, create technology roadmap, assess infrastructure, understand terms and conditions, and improve bottomline—making them invaluable partners for businesses optimizing technology infrastructure and achieving sustainable growth

---

## CHANNELS & EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS

### Advisor Channel Effectiveness

Only 20% of technology buyers acquired services from "the Channel" a few years ago, with projections that in the next few years that number is expected to flip to nearly 80%

—indicating strong secular growth for advisor channel.

**Why Advisors Win:**

Telecom is broken; "solutions" are complicated with quite a few moving parts; complex means buyers need a translator—that is the Trusted Advisor, and this won't change any time soon

---

## SALES PROCESS INTELLIGENCE

### Typical Vendor Direct Sales Process

1. **Enterprise Sales Team**: Large accounts get dedicated account executive
2. **RFP-to-Demo Cycle**: 30-90 days depending on complexity
3. **SLA Negotiation**: Happens in contracting phase
4. **Implementation Oversight**: Vendor delivers with customer IT team
5. **Renewal/Upsell**: Account manager pushes additional modules/seats

### Advisor Sales Process (UPSTACK-Like Model)

1. **Discovery Session**: Map current environment, contracts, business objectives
2. **Evaluation Framework**: Build vendor comparison using proprietary data
3. **Vendor Scoring**: Present scored recommendations (33-day average decision timeline based on UPSTACK data)
4. **Negotiation & Procurement**: Handle contract terms and pricing
5. **Ongoing Lifecycle Management**: Stay involved through implementation and renewal

---

## PARTNERSHIP ECOSYSTEM MAP

### How Advisors Work With Vendors

Most phone and IT vendors have associations with telecom agencies and are compensated for referring business to those agencies, and vendors feel an agency relationship prevents ugly service installations by establishing more control over the process, with agencies representing multiple providers and shopping opportunities with relevant providers to find best and most cost effective solutions, and being involved in transitions from beginning allowing vendors to steer toward appropriate solutions and be available when provider technicians are onsite.

### How Advisors Work With MSPs/VARs

One reason companies have found flexibility to accommodate advisors, VARs and MSPs is a network of partners that can take on the integration work, with vendors bringing solutions purpose-built for outcomes for customers and maximizing high-quality recurring revenues for partners.

---

## MARKETING & MESSAGING ANALYSIS

### Vendor Messaging (Direct Sales)

**Common Positioning:**
- "Platform consolidation" (single vendor = less complexity)

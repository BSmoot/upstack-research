## SUPPLIER DIRECT SALES ANALYSIS (PRIMARY COMPETITION)

### How Major Vendors Sell Direct to Buyers

#### **AT&T (Network/Connectivity)**

AT&T has nearly 150 years of connecting people and a deep understanding of how important it is for businesses to have a dedicated team to help them solve challenges and provide thoughtful insights on how to digitally transform their operations. From consulting and professional services to continuity and planning, they pride themselves in assembling the right folks to solve everyday challenges alongside their customers.

AT&T Dedicated Internet prices are not displayed online because they depend on specific business needs, so you'll need to reach out to a sales representative for a custom quote. AT&T considers factors such as the business's size and location when determining the final cost of a Dedicated Internet plan.

AT&T positioning strategy: Direct sales teams work with enterprise buyers, supplemented by professional services and "expertise" framing to reduce advisor mediation.

#### **Verizon (Network/Connectivity)**

Verizon Business announced a new sales model, Digital Agent, created to bolster new business opportunities for existing and new partners in the Verizon Partner Network. Digital Agent enables channel partners to sell Business Internet, connected laptops and tablets with no deal registration, opportunity or lead required.

As part of Verizon Enterprise Solutions, you'll be leading a team of five to nine sales professionals to bring in new large enterprise accounts. Your team will craft service solutions bringing together just the right elements for your client from professional services, outsourcing, end-to-end communications, mobility and network services, to hosting, cloud services, and security solutions.

Verizon positioning: Direct enterprise sales teams + channel partner enablement (Digital Agent reduces friction for partners to sell independently).

#### **Palo Alto Networks (Security)**

Palo Alto Networks employs a robust sales channel strategy that heavily relies on indirect sales through a comprehensive network of partners. This approach is augmented by direct sales efforts targeting major enterprise and government clients.

Palo Alto Networks' brand positioning is further solidified by its consistent ability to stop advanced adversaries with effective, easy-to-deploy platforms. Their commitment to staying ahead of future threats is evident in their focus on AI-powered security operations and Precision AI® services, as exemplified by their Cortex XDR® solution achieving perfect 100% MITRE ATT&CK results.

Palo Alto positioning: **Buying group strategy** + platform "consolidation" messaging (reducing need for multi-vendor advisory).

#### **CrowdStrike (Security)**

The sales strategy of CrowdStrike centers on a multi-channel approach, combining direct sales with a robust partner network. CrowdStrike's approach to cybersecurity sales and marketing has evolved, with a strategic shift towards empowering its partners. This includes comprehensive training, marketing resources, and technical support, enabling partners to effectively sell and manage the Falcon platform. This strategy has proven successful, as channel partners significantly contributed to new customer acquisitions and revenue growth in fiscal year 2024.

CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) has been named a growth leader among cybersecurity companies selling through the channel. CrowdStrike surpassed the 12 cybersecurity vendors identified in the report, with a year-on-year percentage growth rate of 39.1 for overall channel sales.

CrowdStrike positioning: **Channel-first strategy with direct enterprise support** + marketplace approach (AWS Marketplace = $1B in annual sales).

#### **AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (Cloud)**

According to a Canalys study, enterprise software sales through cloud provider marketplaces are projected to reach $85 billion by 2028.

Cloud vendor positioning: Marketplace self-service reduces advisory friction + extensive partner enablement programs.

### Vendor Positioning AGAINST Advisors

**Key Anti-Advisory Tactics:**

1. **Free Assessments & Consulting**: Vendors position their sales engineers as "consultants," reducing buyer perceived need for external advisors.

2. **Platform Consolidation Messaging**:

The 'platformization' strategy aims to simplify security management by replacing disparate point products with a cohesive ecosystem. This messaging positions single-vendor solutions as superior to multi-vendor evaluation (where advisors add value).

3. **Marketplace Self-Service**: Cloud marketplaces enable buyers to bypass advisors entirely for procurement.

4. **Direct Enterprise Sales**: High-touch direct teams handle complex negotiations, reducing advisor leverage.

5. **Channel Partner Enablement**: Vendors empower resellers and integrators to position themselves as advisors, competing with traditional advisory firms.

---

### Vendor Lock-in Strategies

1. **Platform/Ecosystem Expansion**:

Platformization deals are proving to be more efficient from a sales perspective due to their larger deal sizes. The strategy is supported by key ecosystem partners, including global system integrators, who are investing more resources into joint platformization efforts.

2. **Cloud Marketplace Integration**: AWS Marketplace, Azure Marketplace create proprietary transaction friction that makes switching advisors costly.

3. **Long-term Contracts with Bundled Services**: Vendors combine hardware, software, and managed services in contracts that reduce buyer flexibility.

4. **AI/Automation as Differentiation**:

The widespread adoption and experimentation with AI are creating new security challenges and driving demand for advanced security solutions. Adversaries are using generative AI to accelerate attacks. AI is critical for automating security data analysis and enabling near real-time threat response. Palo Alto Networks is positioning its Cortex platform, particularly Cortex XSIAM, as the AI-powered solution for modern SecOps.

#### **Other Notable Players**

- **Bluewave** (CCaaS/UCaaS focus)
- **AppSmart** (emerging niche)
- **Smaller regional TSBs** (vertically focused)

### Key Competitive Weaknesses of Advisors

1. **Perceived Bias**: Advisors are commission-based; buyers question independence even when vendor-neutral.

2. **Limited Scope**: Advisors typically specialize in 2-3 categories (connectivity, security, UCaaS); fail to address full infrastructure lifecycle.

3. **Vendor Pushback**: Vendors actively discourage buyers from using advisors, positioning direct relationships as "better."

4. **Slower Decisions**: Advisor-mediated evaluations take longer than vendor direct sales (33-day UPSTACK average cited in company context).

5. **No Integration Ownership**: Advisors typically exit post-purchase; vendors own implementation and ongoing support.

---

## CHANNEL EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS

### Direct Sales vs. Channel Effectiveness

By 2027, over half of sales will go through partners, showing their importance. Companies using these networks grow 30% faster than those only using direct sales.

However:

On average, partners bring in 70% of a company's revenue after they start working together

 — indicating high partner contribution but also revenue concentration risk.

### Cloud Marketplace Performance

CrowdStrike hit $1 billion in sales through AWS Marketplace in 2023, demonstrating marketplace viability for direct vendor sales without traditional advisors.

### Hybrid Model Effectiveness

A software company might sell directly to enterprise clients while utilizing channel partners for small to medium-sized businesses. The benefits of combining channel and direct sales can lead to increased revenue, diversified customer engagement, and improved overall performance.

**Key Insight**: Vendors dominating through hybrid approaches (direct enterprise + channel SMB), leaving little room for pure-play advisory firms.

---

## MARKETING & MESSAGING ANALYSIS

### Vendor Messaging Themes

1. **"Platform Consolidation"**: Vendors position comprehensive solutions as superior to multi-vendor environments (implicit: no advisor needed).

2. **"AI-Powered"**:

Their emphasis on AI and ML drives innovation in threat detection and prevention. This is a key differentiator in their cybersecurity sales strategy.

3. **"Buyer Guides" & "Comparisons"**: Vendors publish content that positions them favorably vs. competitors (e.g., Five9 vs. Genesys comparison showing Five9 strengths).

4. **"Trusted Partner" Positioning**: Direct sales reps frame themselves as advisors, reducing perceived need for external advisors.

### Advisory Messaging Themes

1. **"Vendor-Neutral Expertise"**: AVANT, Telarus emphasize independence and multi-supplier optionality.

2. **"Trusted Advisor"**: Advisors position as long-term partners, not transaction facilitators.

3. **"Time Savings & Efficiency"**: Advisors promise faster evaluations, proven methodologies.

4. **"Cost Optimization"**: Advisors emphasize negotiation leverage, avoiding overpayment.

## SALES PROCESS INTELLIGENCE

### Vendor Direct Sales Cycle

- **Typical Length**: 60-90 days for enterprise deals
- **Motion**: Solution-first (vendor demonstrates their platform), buyer education through free POC/assessment
- **Pricing**: Custom quotes, heavily negotiated
- **Incumbent Advantage**: Existing vendor relationships shorten cycle

### Advisory Sales Cycle

Global Technology Advisory market size is expected to reach $205.17 billion by 2029 at 5.3%

 (slower growth than infrastructure services overall)
- **Typical Length**: 30-60 days for discovery + recommendation (per UPSTACK context: 33-day average)
- **Motion**: Buyer problem-first (advisor listens, then evaluates), neutral comparison
- **Pricing**: Commission-based (hidden from buyer), typically 5-15% of deal value

### Buyer Objections to Using Advisors

1. "Why pay commission when vendors give us free advice?"
2. "We prefer direct relationships with vendors for support."
3. "Advisors slow down procurement; we want speed."
4. "Vendor evaluations are now available on G2, Capterra—why need an advisor?"

---

## PARTNERSHIP ECOSYSTEM MAP

### Vendor Partnerships (Creating Competition for Advisors)

1. **System Integrators (SIs)**:

The strategy is supported by key ecosystem partners, including global system integrators, who are investing more resources into joint platformization efforts. SIs act as advisory-adjacent partners, positioning themselves as consultants.

2. **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**: MSPs bundle vendor solutions with managed services, competing with advisor + vendor model.

3. **Resellers/VARs**:

Channel sales account for 91.5 percent of all cybersecurity technology spending with resellers, system integrators and MSSP partners comprising 92 percent of the endpoint security channel market.

4. **Cloud Marketplaces**: Indirect channel that enables buyer self-service without advisors or resellers.

## SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL COMPARISON

| **Model** | **Who Sells** | **Pricing** | **Scope** | **Risk/Lock-in** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Direct Vendor** | Vendor sales reps | Negotiated per deal | Single vendor deep | High switching cost |
| **TSD/Distributor** | Network of advisors | Commission-based | Multi-vendor options | Medium (advisor-bound) |
| **Cloud Marketplace** | Self-service | Transparent, per-use | Catalog of vendors | Low upfront |
| **SI/Integrator** | SI project team | Services + software | End-to-end implementation | High (implementation lock-in) |
| **Channel Advisor** (UPSTACK model) | Vendor-reimbursed advisor | Commission from vendor | Full lifecycle management | Medium (client-owned decision) |

---

## MARKET GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES

### What Vendors Don't Do Well

1. **Honest Comparative Evaluation**: Vendors naturally bias toward their own solutions.
2. **Multi-vendor Lifecycle Management**: Vendors support only their products; buyer left managing others.
3. **Ongoing Optimization**: Post-sale, vendors focus on upsell, not optimization for buyer ROI.
4. **Vendor Consolidation Risk**: As vendors "platformize," buyers risk dependency on single vendors for critical services.

### Where Advisors Have Advantage

1. **Vendor Accountability**:

Multi-year relationships with vendors create ongoing advisory opportunity if advisor can demonstrate continuous value through cost reduction, risk mitigation, and business outcome alignment.

2. **Regulatory Compliance Validation**: Some sectors (healthcare, finance, government) require independent vendor assessment documentation.

3. **Multi-vendor Orchestration**: As infrastructure complexity grows (hybrid cloud, multi-SaaS, edge computing), need for single point of accountability increases.

4. **Buyer Education Gap**:

Industries where complexity, cost, and competition are higher will continue to invest in AI. This includes defense, financial services, healthcare, industry, and retail. Complex procurement still benefits from expert guidance.

### Emerging Opportunities for Advisors

1. **AI/ML Governance Consulting**:

Over 55% of large firms have AI governance boards, making advisory on compliance, ethics, and risk essential in service proposals.

2. **Vendor Risk Management**: As

supply chain attacks are expected to increase 15% year over year through 2031, buyers will increasingly seek independent vendor security assessment.

3. **Cloud/Hybrid Optimization**:

Multi-cloud adoption has crossed 87% of enterprises, while 51% are funding cloud-native modernization tracks. Ongoing optimization remains advisor opportunity.

4. **Sustainability/ESG Technology Advisory**:

Sustainability consulting and green IT advisory services are emerging as a niche area of growth.

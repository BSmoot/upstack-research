## EVALUATION CRITERIA FRAMEWORK
### (Ranked by Importance to Buyers)

### **TIER 1: MISSION-CRITICAL CRITERIA**

**1. Reliability & Uptime SLAs**

DIA providers usually offer robust SLAs, guaranteeing specific levels of uptime, speed, and reliability; Service Level Agreements are a hallmark feature of dedicated fiber, guaranteeing uptime, bandwidth availability, latency, and resolution times.

Both Comcast and Spectrum offer 99.99% uptime SLA for dedicated internet products; Spectrum also provides 100% uptime guarantee for some fiber services, a higher level of assurance promising no downtime, which is a key consideration for businesses where constant connectivity is critical.

**2. Performance & Latency**

Evaluating reliability ensures minimal downtime and consistent data flow vital for business continuity, with packet loss, WAN connectivity, and QoS guarantees ensuring efficient data transmission across branch offices and data centers.

As enterprises adopt hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, the reliability and performance of connectivity between on-premises data centers and public cloud services becomes critical, with cloud interconnects such as Azure ExpressRoute and AWS Direct Connect offering private, dedicated network connections that bypass the public internet to enable consistent bandwidth, lower latency, improved security, and better control over traffic flows.

**3. Security & Compliance**

DIA connections are generally more secure because they are private and can include additional security measures such as encryption and network monitoring; dedicated internet connections can provide higher levels of security, crucial for businesses handling sensitive data and needing to comply with regulations.

In 2025, zero trust will no longer be a forward-thinking approach—it will be the baseline, with organizations recognizing that legacy perimeter-based models are no match for the challenges of hybrid work, cloud adoption, and rising insider threats.

### **TIER 2: OPERATIONAL & FINANCIAL CRITERIA**

**4. Cost & TCO**

When evaluating DIA, buyers must consider not only upfront costs but also ongoing expenses including monthly fees, equipment costs, maintenance, and support, while determining how much budget can be allocated for internet connectivity while balancing it with other operational expenses and priorities.

DIA pricing is negotiable—providers expect negotiation, with counter-offers working effectively, as first quotes include margin for negotiation, and accepting them leaves 10-25% savings on the table.

**5. Scalability & Flexibility**

Buyers must choose solutions offering scalability to accommodate future growth and changing business needs, ensuring the provider can quickly adjust bandwidth levels as needed, with contract terms evaluated to ensure flexibility in scaling up or down without incurring significant penalties.

Dedicated fiber Internet is built to evolve with business, with providers offering flexible plans that can scale as bandwidth needs grow, making it easy to accommodate new workflows, expanded teams, or increased data usage.

**6. Ease of Deployment & Management**

Very few solutions have a single pane of glass for management, optimization, troubleshooting and security, but secure SD-WAN solutions allowing visibility of all functionality in a single place is a win, and one that hosts the management plane is an even bigger win.

Most SD-WAN deployments are cloud-managed and provide a centralized view of the network, making them easier to manage than MPLS.

### **TIER 3: FEATURE & TECHNOLOGY CRITERIA**

**7. Multi-Protocol Support**

SD-WAN offering should be transport-agnostic and support multiple types of connectivity, like MPLS, Ethernet, 4G or 5G, and broadband.

**8. Cloud Optimization**

MPLS was designed for traditional data centers, so connecting to cloud services can be inefficient, while SD-WAN improves cloud access.

As more applications migrate to cloud (IaaS, SaaS), it raises the requirement to connect directly to the Internet rather than backhauling traffic over legacy WAN, so a robust solution must have the capability to identify and classify apps and automatically steer traffic on a per-application basis, enhancing application performance while remaining in compliance with business intent and policy.

**9. Visibility & Analytics**

SD-WAN offers a birds-eye view of the network and traffic, allowing administrators to pinpoint issues and take remedial action, with visibility helping in application prioritization and optimization.

**10. Provisioning Speed**

Provisioning MPLS circuits can take weeks, while provisioning SD-WAN with public-Internet links can be significantly faster, with provisioning of a single site taking minutes or hours with some vendors.

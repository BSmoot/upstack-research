# **TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP INTELLIGENCE REPORT: CIO / CTO / CISO**

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY INSIGHTS**

1. **Role Elevation is Structural, Not Rhetorical**:

82% of surveyed CISOs now report directly to the CEO, a significant increase from 47% in 2023, and

the CIO's role in shaping how the business operates and performs is still expanding, reflecting a nuanced change in expectations as CIOs become more directly involved in nailing down competitive advantage and strategic success across their organizations.

2. **Pain Points Are Layering Faster Than Solutions**:

Longstanding challenges, combined with new pressures, are making the job harder than ever, with analysts at Gartner calling them "exacerbations," recognizing that the CIO job has always been complex but continues to accumulate new layers of difficulty.

3. **AI Transition from Experimentation to Execution**:

CIOs are responsible for moving their organization's AI initiatives from experimentation — which dominated 2025 — to execution, the mandate for 2026, including deciding which AI pilots are worth scaling to generate real returns.

4. **Budget Growth Fails to Address Complexity**:

More than nine in 10 IT decision-makers project their budgets will increase in 2025, though percentage increases at most organizations will be in the single digits, with four in 10 IT leaders expecting increases of less than 5% and about the same percentage expecting a rise by 5% to 10%.

5. **Talent Shortage as Strategic Constraint**:

The most often cited challenge by CIOs is a consistent and widening shortage of tech talent, and because it's impossible to meet their objectives without the right people to execute them, tech leaders are training internally as well as exploring non-traditional paths for new hires, with more than half the respondents saying staffing and skills shortages "took time away from more strategic and innovation pursuits".

6. **CISO Role Has Fundamentally Transformed**:

The modern CISO operates at the nexus of technology, strategy and compliance, with their responsibilities extending beyond traditional technical oversight, encompassing regulatory compliance and strategic alignment, and

93% of organizations made policy changes over the preceding 12 months to address concerns about increased personal liability for CISOs, including two in five organizations (41%) increasing CISO participation in strategic decisions at the board level.

7. **CTO Role Increasingly Balances Innovation with Business Outcomes**:

Today's CTOs are strategic partners who work closely with CEOs, COOs, and CFOs to align technology investments with business goals, and CTOs are expected to translate business goals into actionable tech-powered strategies.

---

## **ROLE DEFINITION & RESPONSIBILITIES**

### **The CIO (Chief Information Officer)**

A CIO is responsible for defining and executing a company's technology vision and strategy, overseeing IT infrastructure, leading engineering teams, and ensuring technology supports business goals.

**Operational Reality:**

CIOs move into 2026 with more extensive responsibilities, including AI strategy, regulatory compliance and workforce transformation.

CIOs are increasingly viewed as business leaders, not technology leaders, seeking to understand business challenges and see where technology can play a role in solving them, and many CIOs do not consider themselves the 'owners' of all technology platforms and products and want to implement technology thoughtfully and in partnership with stakeholders.

**Day-to-Day Reality:**

CIOs face pressure to demonstrate measurable value, maximize investments and optimize costs, while still driving key digital initiatives forward.

CIOs report having a security overload, where everyone has 20+ products to cover and they keep getting things to make systems safer, but at some point, it's too much and you can't move.

### **The CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)**

In 2025, the CISO is no longer a technical silo but an executive stakeholder at the intersection of business growth, regulatory risk, and operational continuity—yet responsibility is increasing faster than authority.

**Decision-Making Expansion:**

In 2025, organizations increasingly treated cybersecurity as a core business priority, not just an IT function, with CISOs gaining influence over revenue protection, M&A risk, and operational continuity, shaping strategic decisions across the enterprise.

**Pressure Points:**

66% of security leaders surveyed for the 2025 State of Cybersecurity report from professional association ISACA said their roles are more stressful today than they were five years ago — in the midst of a pandemic.

Most CISOs are stretched thin, dealing with nonstop incidents, too many tools, and growing pressure from their boards, with pressures so intense that many say they are burned out and thinking about walking away.

### **The CTO (Chief Technology Officer)**

CTOs are central to innovation, growth, and business transformation, and as companies increasingly rely on technology to scale and compete, the CTO role remains both vital and in high demand.

**Key Responsibilities:**

The CTO creates strategic plans and defines and executes the technological vision of the company, and they are also involved in recommending excellent innovative solutions, communicating the vision of the company both internally and externally, and taking the responsibility of explaining any technological changes that might occur in an organization.

**Strategic Positioning:**

CTOs examine the short and long term needs of an organization, and utilize capital to make investments designed to help the organization reach its objectives, and CTOs will make decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while CIOs work alongside the organization's IT staff members to perform everyday operations.

---

## **DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY MAP**

### **CIO Authority & Influence**

**Primary Decision Authority:**

CIOs are responsible for the IT budget, though they aren't the only ones responsible for approving the budget, and they often devise and manage that budget in conjunction with an executive IT steering committee, other executives and directors, and other information C-level executives, including the chief digital officer, chief data officer and chief information security officer.

64% of CIOs work with vendors to help them develop the business case around their investment in IT.

Vendor consolidation has emerged as the dominant priority for CIOs in 2025, with 68% of CIOs planning to consolidate their vendor landscape, with a majority of organizations targeting a 20% reduction in vendor count.

**Shared Authority (Must Collaborate):**

CIOs become more directly involved in nailing down competitive advantage and strategic success across their organizations

 (requires CEO/CFO/business leader alignment).

As CIOs work on foundational areas, like architecture, cybersecurity and data, they are increasingly called upon to demonstrate the value of tech investments and how they are contributing to business priorities.

### **CISO Authority & Influence**

**Rising Decision Authority:**

The CISO's rise to the C-suite comes with more engagement with the boardroom, an audience with the CEO, and the power to make strategic decisions for the business, with 82% of surveyed CISOs now reporting directly to the CEO, a significant increase from 47% in 2023, and 83% of CISOs participating in board meetings somewhat often or most of the time.

Boards are relying on CISOs for strategic input—and in some cases, holding them personally accountable for regulatory failures.

**Responsibility Without Always Having Authority:**

Responsibility is increasing faster than authority, with CISOs being asked to do more—secure more systems, evaluate more vendors, and protect against more threats—with roughly the same budget as last year, and nearly half of CISOs saying their budget is flat, and 43% reporting no change in technology spend year-over-year.

### **CTO Authority & Influence**

**Technology Strategy Authority:**

The CTO typically reports directly to the CIO and is responsible for designing and recommending the appropriate technology solutions to support the CIO's policies and directives, and CTOs also work with various departments to implement the organization's technology plans.

Today's CTOs are strategic partners who work closely with CEOs, COOs, and CFOs to align technology investments with business goals, and CTOs are expected to translate business goals into actionable tech-powered strategies.

## **PAIN POINT ANALYSIS (RANKED TOP 5)**

### **1. DEMONSTRATING MEASURABLE VALUE FROM AI (PRIORITY COMPRESSION)**

There is a constant requirement for CIOs to prove the value, and

the revolutionary impact of AI is challenging IT leaders to think about the value.

**The Challenge:**

IDC predicts that in 2026, over one-third of organizations will be stuck in the experimental, point-solution phase of AI experimentation, requiring a shift of focus to enterprise use cases to deliver ROI, and this stagnation hinders competitiveness, slows growth, and increases exposure to ethical risks and regulatory scrutiny.

**CTO/CIO Perspective:**

Most IT leaders have the goal of improving business outcomes, while their top challenge is a lack of skills in this area, and people are struggling to find value in AI because their data is not structured, cleansed and mastered in a way that can be useful with AI.

---

### **2. TALENT SHORTAGE & SKILLS GAP (OPERATIONAL CRISIS)**

The most often cited challenge by CIOs is a consistent and widening shortage of tech talent, and because it's impossible to meet their objectives without the right people to execute them, tech leaders are training internally as well as exploring non-traditional paths for new hires.

**Market Dynamics:**

Nearly two-thirds of technology hiring managers (65%) say it's more challenging to find skilled professionals than it was a year ago, with many organizations growing concerned about whether they can secure professionals with the right specialized skills and depth of experience quickly enough to keep strategic priorities, including AI and ML integration, on track.

**Hidden Cost:**

In CIO's most recent State of the CIO survey 2025, more than half the respondents said staffing and skills shortages "took time away from more strategic and innovation pursuits".

---

### **3. SECURITY COMPLEXITY & CISO BURNOUT (LEADERSHIP CRISIS)**

CISOs are dealing with rising risks, competing priorities, limited budgets, and more, with 10 issues that are top of mind today.

**Concrete Pressures:**

A 2025 survey from Boston Consulting Group found that 80% of CISOs worldwide cited AI-powered cyberattacks as their top concern, a 19-point increase from the previous year.

76% of CISOs feel at risk of experiencing a material cyberattack in the next 12 months, yet 58% say they are unprepared to respond, with the surge in cyberattacks fueling heightened anxiety among CISOs—along with a growing willingness to pay ransoms when incidents occur—and the rapid rise of GenAI is forcing security leaders to balance innovation with risk.

**Burnout Reality:**

Most CISOs are stretched thin, dealing with nonstop incidents, too many tools, and growing pressure from their boards, with pressures so intense that many say they are burned out and thinking about walking away.

---

### **4. COST CONTROL AMID RISING COMPLEXITY (BUDGET PARADOX)**

CIOs say 2026 will see an end to unchecked spending on AI projects, where cost discipline must go hand-in-hand with strategy and innovation, with a focus on practical applications of AI that augment workforce and streamline operations, and every technology investment must be aligned with business goals and financial discipline.

**The Paradox:**

More than nine in 10 IT decision-makers project their budgets will increase in 2025, though percentage increases at most organizations will be in the single digits, with four in 10 IT leaders expecting IT budgets to increase by less than 5%, and about the same percentage expecting a rise by 5% to 10%.

**Real Impact:**

Increased technology costs will consume all or most of IT budget growth, with all major categories reflecting higher-than-expected prices, prompting CIOs to defer and scale back their true budget expectations.

---

### **5. MULTI-LAYERED REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE BURDEN (EXTERNAL PRESSURE)**

As new regulations reshape data, AI, security and cloud operations, CIOs must adapt quickly, and regulatory compliance is now a fundamental responsibility for nearly all CIOs, so staying informed about compliance trends is essential to avoid significant operational and financial impacts.

**CISO Personal Liability:**

As CISOs' responsibilities expand, they face increasing personal exposure, and as cybersecurity risks increasingly translate into business risks, CISOs now face heightened accountability from both regulators and board members alike, with growing personal liability for compliance failures or data breaches.

**Breadth of Compliance:**

Regulatory compliance, business continuity and resilience, and managing AI-related risk are top focus areas

 for security leadership.

---

## **COMMUNICATION & CONTENT PREFERENCES**

### **Where Technology Leaders Spend Time**

With 34 communities across the globe, serving over 3,600 CIOs, Gartner C-level Communities are powerful networks of technology executives, bringing together CIOs from diverse experiences, backgrounds and industries, and through peer sharing and collaboration, CIOs from the world's leading organizations drive innovative ideas, exchange best practices and forward-looking perspectives, and address critical issues at the forefront of technology today.

**Event Preference:**

Gartner CIO Leadership Forum is an exclusive conference for chief information officers, and this means attendees are guaranteed a level of information exchange and peer interaction that is unrivaled.

### **Content Consumption Preferences**

**Peer Intelligence Over Vendor Claims:**

CIOs exchange peer-validated strategies, solutions and partners, and access exclusive community insights to learn how other CIOs approach similar challenges.

**Verification-Focused:**

67% say that when all stakeholders are aware of a brand, it makes the internal sell through process easier

 — suggesting CIOs respond to multi-stakeholder visibility rather than vendor hype.

**Real-World Case Studies Matter:**

Using case studies from early deployments can strengthen the argument and provide tangible evidence of potential returns.

---

## **BUYING BEHAVIOR & VENDOR SELECTION**

### **Vendor Evaluation Criteria**

To figure out which technology supplier is best, organizations designate four or five members of the technology department to lead the selection process, defining broad areas to assess, including customer satisfaction, product and vendor reliability, and how well the vendor helps achieve business goals.

**Key Selection Factors:**

Pricing (meaning value for the money but also the vendor's flexibility in bargaining) and innovation (not just in new features but in new approaches to solving problems).

Reliability, which can be measured in a scorecard by tracking calls to the help desk about a particular piece of software or hardware, downtime and customer complaints, with IT departments reviewing vendor compliance with service level agreements every quarter.

### **Consolidation Trend**

Vendor consolidation has emerged as the dominant priority for CIOs in 2025, driven by mounting pressure to reduce complexity, control costs, and maximize the full potential of AI, with 68% of CIOs planning to consolidate their vendor landscape, with a majority of organizations targeting a 20% reduction in vendor count.

**Why Consolidation Matters:**

The move from fragmented, point solutions towards trusted, best-of-breed platforms is a trend that will continue to gain momentum in 2025, with budget and talent constraints, coupled with the complexities of managing multiple non-integrated systems, making consolidation a priority for CISOs.

### **Procurement Process Complexity**

Around 66% of ITDMs in APAC agree that the purchase process for technology products and services is becoming increasingly complex, with more people involved as business and IT leaders present and explore new technologies, and the average number of people involved is 31.

---

## **OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORK**

### **"We already have tools for that"**

**Root Cause:**

One of the largest drivers of complexity, and greatest barriers to achieving resilience, is when CISOs develop a "hostage mindset" around tech that is old and antiquated, with CISOs often continuing to use vendors because it is easy—already a part of their infrastructure—but easy is rarely synonymous with secure, and the moment a CISO considers moving off of a vendor impossible or too difficult, is when the balance of power begins to shift back in favor of threat actors.

**Response Opportunity:** Lead with **portfolio rationalization**, not replacement. Frame as "optimization under existing budget."

### **"This won't integrate with our legacy systems"**

**Root Cause:**

62% of strategy leaders noted an overburdened legacy operating model cannot support current and future strategic objectives and plans.

**Response Opportunity:** Acknowledge technical debt as a shared pain point. Offer phased integration with "quick wins" to build internal momentum.

### **"We don't have budget for this"**

**Root Cause:**

Nearly half of CISOs say their budget is flat, and 43% report no change in technology spend year-over-year.

**Response Opportunity:** Position as **cost avoidance**, not new spend. Quantify risk of inaction or cost of status quo.

### **"Security/compliance won't approve"**

**Root Cause:**

The CISO is no longer a technical silo but an executive stakeholder at the intersection of business growth, regulatory risk, and operational continuity—yet responsibility is increasing faster than authority.

**Response Opportunity:** Bring CISO into conversation early as a **strategic partner**, not a gatekeeper. Frame as "enabling faster compliance."

---

## **VALUE PROPOSITION & PROOF POINTS**

### **What Business Outcomes Matter Most**

**To CIOs:**

CIOs are increasingly viewed as business leaders, not technology leaders, seeking to understand business challenges and see where technology can play a role in solving them.

Stakeholders want to know how IT enables the strategic agenda and how IT's activities benefit the broader organization, and CIOs must make IT relevant to the desired outcomes of the stakeholders and articulate the business outcomes of the technology investment.

**To CISOs:**

CISOs gained influence over revenue protection, M&A risk, and operational continuity, shaping strategic decisions across the enterprise.

Boards now expect cyber risk insights that clearly connect to business outcomes, and boards want assurance that cybersecurity supports business goals and that the organization has a strategic roadmap for security and innovation.

**To CTOs:**

Today's CTOs are strategic partners who work closely with CEOs, COOs, and CFOs to align technology investments with business goals, and CTOs are expected to translate business goals into actionable tech-powered strategies.

### **Proof Points That Resonate**

**Peer Validation Over Vendor Claims:**

CIOs exchange peer-validated strategies, solutions and partners, and access exclusive community insights to learn how other CIOs approach similar challenges.

**Measurable ROI:**

CIOs must communicate the business value of AI spending in ways that resonate with executives and boards, linking initiatives to measurable outcomes such as revenue growth, cost reduction, productivity gains, or improved customer experience, and using case studies from early deployments can strengthen the argument and provide tangible evidence of potential returns.

**Risk Mitigation:**

As cyber threats become more frequent and multifaceted, CISOs are increasingly concerned about their organization's ability to withstand a material attack, with 76% of CISOs feeling at risk of experiencing a material cyberattack in the next 12 months, yet 58% saying they are unprepared to respond.

## **MESSAGING GUIDELINES FOR TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP**

### **CIO Messaging Framework**

**DO:**
- Lead with **business outcomes**, not technology features
- Focus on **reducing complexity** (their #1 unspoken pain point)
- Use language of "enabling," "orchestrating," "optimizing"
- Reference **peer benchmarks** and industry validation
- Address both **cost control** and **innovation acceleration** simultaneously

**DON'T:**
- Describe the technical architecture in depth
- Position as "replacing" existing tools (triggers "hostage mindset")
- Promise quick wins without acknowledging integration complexity
- Use language that diminishes IT's role (CIOs are now strategic business partners)

### **CISO Messaging Framework**

**DO:**
- Frame as **enabling business resilience** and growth
- Acknowledge **impossible mandates** (growing responsibility + flat budgets)
- Position as **reducing board-level risk**, not just preventing breaches
- Reference **vendor consolidation** as a strategic cost lever
- Acknowledge **burnout reality** while offering practical relief

**DON'T:**
- Lead with compliance requirements (secondary to business outcomes)
- Frame as a "security initiative" (it's a business risk management initiative)
- Assume unlimited budget (nearly half have flat budgets)
- Ignore the personal liability pressure

### **CTO Messaging Framework**

**DO:**
- Frame as **driving competitive advantage** through technology choices
- Emphasize **strategic alignment** with CEO/COO/CFO priorities
- Focus on **innovation velocity** with reduced technical debt
- Reference **future-proofing** and architectural decisions made today

**DON'T:**
- Position as separate from business strategy (CTOs now own strategy translation)
- Focus on internal IT operations (that's CIO territory)
- Use abstract innovation language without business impact

---

## **OUTBOUND SEQUENCE DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Timing & Receptivity**

**Most Receptive to Outreach:**

More than nine in 10 IT decision-makers project their budgets will increase in 2025, though increases will be in the single digits

 — **Budget planning season (Q3-Q4 prior year)** is peak receptivity.
- **Post-conference windows** (after Gartner CIO Leadership Forum, industry summits) when peers have shared new approaches.
- **When dealing with vendor churn** (consolidation moving from aspiration to execution in 2026).

### **Multi-Touch Sequence**

**Touch 1 (Education):** Lead with a **peer insight** or **market shift** angle, not a product demo. Example: "68% of CIOs are consolidating vendors—here's what we're seeing from companies ahead of the curve."

**Touch 2 (Validation):** Provide a **specific, quantified business outcome** from a recognized peer or within their industry vertical.

**Touch 3 (Conversation Starter):** Ask about **one specific pain point** (consolidation complexity, AI ROI measurement, vendor sprawl cost) with evidence that others in their peer group are addressing it.

**Touch 4 (Facilitate Peer Exchange):** Offer an **off-the-record conversation** with a peer CIO/CISO/CTO who has tackled the same problem. Peer testimonial is the highest-credibility trigger.

---

## **CROSS-VERTICAL INSIGHTS**

### **Variations by Organization Size**

**Enterprise (5000+ employees):**
- CISOs have more board engagement;

for companies with annual revenues exceeding $10 billion, almost two-thirds of CISOs interact with the board at least quarterly.
- Technology decision-making is more distributed;

the average number of people involved is 31.

**Mid-Market (1000-5000 employees):**
- CISOs have lower board engagement;

at organizations with annual revenues under $400 million, only 37% reported monthly or quarterly board engagements; and 42% meet with their boards on an ad hoc basis.
- Consolidation pressure is more acute because vendor sprawl is harder to manage with smaller teams.

### **Variations by Industry**

**Financial Services & Insurance:**
- **Pain Point Elevation:** Regulatory compliance and AI risk governance are board-level priorities.
- **CIO Focus:**

When CEOs pick the question that concerns them most, after technology and AI is an issue related to innovation: is my company's innovation capability adequate for our uncertain future.

**Healthcare:**
- **CISO Pressure:** Higher personal liability due to HIPAA/HITECH regulatory requirements.
- **Data Governance:**

Successful healthcare transformations yield 124% average ROI through improved outcomes and operational efficiency.

**Retail:**
- **CIO Priority:**

E-commerce drives 60% of analytics deployments as online-offline integration becomes critical, with retailers using advanced analytics reporting 15-20% revenue increases and 30% improvement in inventory efficiency.

**Manufacturing:**
- **CTO Leadership:**

92% believe smart manufacturing drives competitiveness, with companies allocating average 25% of capital budgets to smart manufacturing initiatives, up from 15% in 2026.

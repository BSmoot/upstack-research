# COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT: INFRASTRUCTURE ADVISORY MARKET
## Channel & Competitive Landscape Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The infrastructure advisory market is experiencing strong growth alongside massive vendor consolidation, with total IT consulting services projected to reach **$619.32 billion by 2025** and **$850 billion by 2035**. The competitive landscape is shaped by three distinct forces:

1. **Direct Vendor Sales (PRIMARY COMPETITION)**: Dominant vendors in networking (Verizon, AT&T), security (Palo Alto, CrowdStrike), CCaaS (Genesys, NICE, Five9), and cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) are expanding direct sales capacity and building integrated solutions that compete with advisory services by embedding advisory into their products and partnerships.

2. **Technology Service Brokers/Advisors (SECONDARY COMPETITION)**: A fragmented advisor ecosystem including traditional TSBs, system integrators, and consulting firms. UPSTACK's differentiation lies in its vendor-reimbursed model, proprietary transaction data, and lifecycle management focus—NOT in competing on advisory breadth.

3. **Market Gap**: The "unmanaged vendor lifecycle" between procurement events remains the primary white space. Enterprises lack systematic oversight of 30+ active vendor relationships, renewal management, and contract optimization—where UPSTACK operates distinctly.

## SUPPLIER DIRECT SALES ANALYSIS (PRIMARY COMPETITION)

### How Major Vendors Sell Directly

#### **NETWORK & CONNECTIVITY VENDORS** (AT&T, Verizon, Lumen, Comcast)

The traditional battle lines of the US business wireless market are being redrawn. AT&T led in perception for large enterprises, Verizon the midsized market, and T-Mobile leveraged consumer momentum in small business, but carriers are aggressively crossing into each other's territories.

**Direct Sales Motion**:

5G is transforming competition from smartphones into strategic engagement with C-suites to solve their most pressing connectivity needs.

- Enterprise sales teams target large accounts with bundled fiber + wireless + managed services

Verizon's overarching strategy is convergence—by owning both the "pipes" in the ground (fiber) and the "waves" in the air (5G), to be the sole provider of a household's entire digital life.

**Competitive Positioning vs. Advisors**:
- Direct relationships eliminate need for third-party evaluation
- Integrated services (connectivity + security + cloud edge) position as single-vendor solutions
- Long-term contracts create lock-in

**Vendor Lock-In Strategies**:

With 2026 fiber expansion to nearly 30 million passings, fiber offers higher margins and lower churn than traditional wireless.

- Private 5G networks create switching costs
- Bundled pricing (e.g., "convergence" packages) makes vendor comparison difficult

**Free Advisory from Vendors**:
- Verizon, AT&T offer "network design" services embedded in sales process
- No independent evaluation framework—advisory is sales-driven

---

#### **SECURITY VENDORS** (Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Zscaler, Fortinet)

**Direct Sales Motion**:

Palo Alto Networks focuses broadly on next-generation firewalls, cloud security and AI-driven threat detection, while CrowdStrike specializes in endpoint protection and extended detection and response, offering AI-native cloud security through its Falcon platform.

**Direct Positioning Against Advisors**:

CrowdStrike is positioned highest for ability to execute and furthest to the right for completeness of vision.

- Both vendors emphasize "unified platform" vs. "best-of-breed" approaches that require integration expertise

Palo Alto Networks' fragmented platform is spread over multiple disjointed consoles and requires multiple separate agents for full platform functionality, lengthening deployment time and hindering SOC effectiveness.

**Vendor Lock-In**:

CrowdStrike's single console consolidates endpoint, cloud, identity, data protection, IT automation, SIEM, exposure management, and more.

- Switching costs embedded in API dependencies and training investment
- Proprietary threat intelligence (CrowdStrike) vs. curated (Palo Alto)

**Free Assessment Strategies**:
- Both offer "security posture assessments" as part of sales cycle
- CrowdStrike: 15-day free trial
- Palo Alto: competitive displacement analysis

---

#### **CCaaS VENDORS** (Five9, Genesys, NICE, Amazon Connect, Talkdesk)

**Vendor Positioning & Direct Sales**:

Based on 2024 performance, NICE, Genesys and Amazon Connect are the global leaders by seat count, with AI innovation fueling broader industry momentum.

Platforms like Genesys, NICE, and Five9 are proprietary software suites with curated application marketplaces and rigid, per-seat licensing models.

**How They Compete With Advisors**:
1. **Embedding into CRM platforms**:

Many cloud contact center vendors have embedded their voice and digital channels into CRM platforms. AWS, Five9, and Genesys have done so with Salesforce Service Cloud, and the latter two followed suit with ServiceNow Customer Service Management.

2. **AI-powered "advisory"**:

These vendors have invested heavily in impressive AI suites (NICE Enlighten AI, Genesys AI, Five9 Genius AI). These tools are powerful, but they are self-contained, proprietary AI ecosystems where you are dependent on a single vendor's R&D pipeline and access is often gated by complex licensing tiers or sold as token-based add-ons.

3. **Vertical solutions**: Talkdesk emphasizes "vertical-specific" offerings; Genesys emphasizes complex deployments; Five9 focuses on outbound/sales optimization

**Pricing & Lock-In**:

Genesys Cloud CX plans start at $75 per month, per user, with access to analytics, reporting, AI tools, and voice capabilities, with more advanced plans ranging up to $240 per agent per month.

- Per-seat model creates predictable vendor revenue and switching friction

Genesys has a strong global footprint with regional offices in many countries and a broad partner ecosystem, making it easier to find implementation expertise.

**Free Assessment Strategies**:
- Vendor-led "Contact Center Optimization" assessments
- Embedded AI recommendations within platform (not independent)

---

#### **CLOUD VENDORS** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

**Vendor Direct Sales Model**:

AWS's cloud software holds a market share of 33%, Microsoft Azure has a market share of 21%, and Google Cloud has a market share of 11%.

AWS is known for the broadest service catalog, Azure stands out for Microsoft integration and enterprise/hybrid environments, and Google Cloud is strongest in data analytics and AI/ML.

**Channel Partner Programs & Direct Sales**:

AWS Marketplace's channel partner ecosystem seamlessly connects buyers, ISVs, and consulting/channel partners to reduce friction in transactions. The CPPO model empowers ISVs to authorize channel partners with access to wholesale pricing.

Azure's Multiparty Private Offers operate similarly to AWS's CPPO, empowering ISVs to scale their business and establish recurring revenue through channel partnerships.

**How They Compete With Advisors**:
1. **Ecosystem control**: Cloud vendors increasingly control vendor selection through marketplace curation
2. **Free advisory**:

AWS's biggest strength is its maturity and the sheer scale and variety of its services with the largest market share, a vast partner network, and extensive documentation and community support.

3. **Lock-in through workload portability**: Once workloads are deployed, switching carries high operational cost (not license cost)

**Free Assessment Strategies**:

AWS's TCO calculator provides a detailed analysis of cost savings when moving to AWS compared to on-premises or colocation environments.

- Cloud readiness assessments embedded in sales process
- Partnership with consulting firms (but cloud vendor controls narrative)

---

### Vendor Positioning AGAINST Advisory/Broker Model

**Common Vendor Objections to Using Advisors**:
1. "We give better pricing direct" (not universally true—UPSTACK data shows advisors negotiate better)
2. "Our platform is integrated; advisors fragment the solution" (position consolidation as strength)
3. "We have free advisory built-in" (but vendor-biased)
4. "Your team can use our marketplace" (but curated, not independent)

**Vendor Motivation to Bypass Advisors**:

Working with a TSB can be a cost-effective solution for vendors, as they can leverage the TSB's existing relationships to reach a wider audience and generate more sales at a lower cost than they would be able to achieve on their own.

- However, vendors prefer direct relationships to capture full economics and control customer narrative

## ADVISORY COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Major Advisory Players

Based on research, the advisory competitive set includes:

| Competitor | Model | Positioning | Strength | Weakness |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **AVANT** | Broker (VoIP, UCaaS) | Specialized in telecom/UC | Deep carrier relationships | Limited infrastructure breadth |
| **Telarus** | Broker (connectivity) | Carrier-neutral positioning | Large partner base | Commoditized on price |
| **Bluewave** | Broker (MSP/cloud) | Focus on SMB cloud adoption | Easy deployment | Limited enterprise scale |
| **AppSmart** | Broker (SaaS) | SaaS evaluation & cost | Vendor-independent | SaaS-only focus |
| **Deloitte/Accenture/IBM** | Large consulting | Enterprise transformation | Brand, resources | Expensive, slow, large-deal only |
| **System integrators (CDW, CDI, etc.)** | Reseller + advisory | Channel-based | Local presence | Vendor-affiliated (conflicts) |

### UPSTACK's Competitive Position

**Differentiation (Not Head-to-Head Comparison)**:
1. **Vendor-reimbursed model** (same as other TSBs, but execution matters)
2. **Proprietary transaction data** (5,759 evaluations, 3,766 closed deals in 12 months) → structural advantage
3. **End-to-end lifecycle management** (not just procurement)
4. **33-day evaluation-to-decision timeline** (vs. industry norm of 60+ days)
5. **NPS of 78** (category-leading for advisory)
6. **99.8% retention** among revenue-generating customers

**Where Competitors Win**:
- Large consulting firms: Enterprise-scale transformations, C-suite sponsorship
- Specialized brokers (AVANT, Telarus): Deep vertical expertise (UC, connectivity)
- System integrators: Local service, integration capability
- Vendors: Free advisory (but biased), integrated solutions

---

## CHANNEL & PARTNERSHIP STRATEGIES

### How Vendors Use Channels

Vendors rarely have direct sales reps available for small businesses or the mid-market, so they outsource sales to partners. One direct rep can cover a territory, while a partner rep can cover a set of partners, each with multiple sales people and cover a much larger area.

**Partner Types**:
1. **VARs (Value Added Resellers)**:

Partners provide many benefits to vendors, from broad geographic coverage to deep industry knowledge, from integration capabilities to custom service and support, and from local intimacy to trusted advisor.

2. **MSPs (Managed Service Providers)**: Own the ongoing operational relationship
3. **Cloud Marketplace Partners**: ISVs and integrators selling via AWS/Azure marketplaces
4. **Advisors/Brokers**: Lower priority for vendors (less margin, less control)

**Channel Effectiveness**:

Vendors often ask which partner type is best to recruit—VARs with vertical industry expertise or VARs with broad geographic reach. Both can play important roles, dependent upon needs and resources.

- Large vendors increasingly own direct sales; channel relegated to SMB

---

## MARKETING & POSITIONING ANALYSIS

### Vendor Marketing Themes (2026)

1. **AI as Differentiator**:

AI is driving a new wave of CCaaS market growth. Vendors with strong AI portfolios saw higher price-per-seat and consumption-based revenue in 2024. AI is the key driver—vendors that offer transcription, real-time agent guidance, summarization and other AI tools are outperforming those that don't.

2. **Convergence (Telecom)**:

The dominant trend in 2026 is "The Great Convergence." Consumers are increasingly looking for a single bill for their mobile, home internet, and streaming services.

3. **Integration/Platform**:

As basic features become commodities, the real battleground has shifted to architectural agility, integrated AI intelligence, and commercial flexibility. The perceived safety of a proprietary, all-in-one suite from vendors like Genesys, NICE, Five9, and Cisco versus the strategic power of an open, consumption-based model.

### Advisory Positioning (Inferred from Competitor Analysis)

- **Large consulting firms**: "Digital transformation partner" + change management
- **Specialized brokers**: "Carrier expert" / "Cloud specialist"
- **System integrators**: "Local implementation partner"
- **UPSTACK unique**: "Vendor lifecycle manager" (not elsewhere articulated in market)

---

## SALES PROCESS INTELLIGENCE

### Typical Vendor Sales Cycle (60-90 days)

1. **Prospecting** (2-3 weeks): Outbound from vendor or inbound from channel
2. **Needs Assessment** (1-2 weeks): Vendor-led discovery (biased toward own solutions)
3. **Demo/Evaluation** (2-3 weeks): Single vendor or limited competitive set
4. **Negotiation** (2-3 weeks): Vendor controls pricing
5. **Close** (1-2 weeks)

**Where Advisors Add Value**:
- Step 2 (independent discovery, not vendor-led)
- Step 3 (multi-vendor evaluation, not biased)
- Step 4 (negotiation leverage based on market intelligence)

### Pricing Transparency

Five9 displays pricing for Digital ($119) and Core ($159) plans, with telephony usage billed separately. This less transparent approach makes early comparisons difficult and often requires a detailed needs audit to get a reliable estimate.

**Vendor Strategy**: Opacity in pricing creates dependency on sales reps (not advisors). UPSTACK's value: pricing transparency and benchmarking.

## SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL COMPARISON

### Advisory Service Models

| Model | Provider | Engagement | Economics | Duration |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Pure Procurement Advice** | Brokers, TSBs | Evaluation + selection | Vendor-reimbursed | 30-90 days |
| **Ongoing Managed Advisory** | Large consulting | Strategic + execution | Customer-paid fees | 1-3 years |
| **Co-managed/Hybrid** | System integrators | Channel + advisory | Customer-paid + vendor margin | Ongoing |
| **Full Lifecycle Management** | UPSTACK | Evaluation through renewal | Vendor-reimbursed | Ongoing (3.5-yr avg) |

**Market Trend**: Shift from project-based (evaluation only) to ongoing lifecycle management—where UPSTACK dominates.

---

## PARTNERSHIP ECOSYSTEM MAP

### Key Partnerships That Compete With Advisors

1. **Hyperscaler + Integrator**: AWS + Accenture, Azure + Deloitte
2. **Vendor + Reseller**: CrowdStrike + CDW, Genesys + local integrators
3. **Marketplace + Channel**: AWS CPPO + ISV ecosystems
4. **Carrier + Integrator**: Verizon + large SI for enterprise

### Where UPSTACK Fits

## MARKET GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES

### Underserved Buyer Needs

1. **Vendor Lifecycle Gap** (PRIMARY):

Information Technology Consulting Services Market is witnessing robust growth as businesses globally increasingly rely on expert IT advisory services to streamline operations, enhance digital transformation, and drive sustainable growth. The market is expanding due to the accelerated adoption of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other emerging technologies. Organizations are seeking consulting services not only for technical implementation but also for strategic planning, IT infrastructure optimization, cybersecurity enhancement, and business process digitization.

2. **Complexity of Multi-Vendor Evaluation**: As vendors consolidate (e.g., CrowdStrike/Palo Alto competing across multiple domains), buyers need independent framework to evaluate "best-of-breed" vs. "integrated suite" trade-offs

3. **Contract Optimization**:

SMEs are increasingly leveraging IT consulting services to implement cost-effective digital strategies and scalable infrastructure. Additionally, the rise of cloud-first strategies across industries presents opportunities for cloud migration and optimization consulting.

4. **Emerging Geographies**:

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on this intelligence:

1. **Lead with Problem, Not Solution**:

The Contact Center as a Service market is at a crossroads. The choice is no longer just about moving to the cloud; it's about picking a philosophy that will define your customer experience for the next decade. As basic features become commodities, the real battleground has shifted to architectural agility, integrated AI intelligence, and commercial flexibility.

 This framing applies across all infrastructure categories.

2. **Leverage Proprietary Data**: UPSTACK's 5,759 evaluations and 3,766 closed deals create a defensible moat. Competitors cannot replicate this dataset. Use it as evidence of market intelligence.

3. **Position Against Vendor Bias, Not Vendor Features**: The primary competition is not other advisors—it's vendors' free (biased) advisory embedded in their sales process. Differentiate on independence, not breadth of vendor relationships.

4. **Expand Lifecycle Ownership**: Most competitors focus on procurement (30-90 days). UPSTACK's 3.5-year average tenure suggests opportunity to extend advisory through renewal, renegotiation, and emerging technology adoption cycles.

5. **Watch for Vendor Consolidation**: As vendors consolidate (Palo Alto acquired Satigent, CrowdStrike expands), buyer need for independent evaluation framework increases.

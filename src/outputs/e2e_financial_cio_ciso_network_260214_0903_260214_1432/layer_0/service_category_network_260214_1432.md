## BUYER DISCOVERY PATTERNS

### How Buyers Discover Network Connectivity Needs

Unreliable internet connectivity can hold organizations back from implementing digital strategies, with networks having insufficient bandwidth and inconsistent performance causing problems that impact collaborative efforts of distributed workforces, such as the ability to share large files faster, participate in videoconferencing, and support cloud-based applications.

**Trigger Events for Evaluation:**

Lack of sufficient bandwidth causes productivity to decline as workers wait to send or access files, and when an employee is diverted from an active work project, it takes an average of 25 minutes to refocus on their prior task.

Network downtime is a major pain point, costing businesses thousands of dollars per minute, damaging company reputation and customer satisfaction, and increasing the risk of security breaches.

Productivity is hindered by network connectivity issues caused by VPNs and outdated security measures, with security being essential but shouldn't slow down productivity outside the office.

### Where Buyers Research Network Solutions

**Review Platforms:**

G2 is arguably the biggest B2B SaaS product review website, very popular with buyers, attracting an average of five million monthly visitors reviewing nearly 1.4 million user reviews, with businesses reviewed on a five-star rating scale covering everything from setup and ease of use to security and support.

TrustRadius benefits vendors with larger target accounts being more often on TrustRadius, whereas G2 is used more for smaller target accounts as the audience tends to be more SMB and mid-market.

Gartner Peer Insights data is explicitly used as one input into Magic Quadrant and Critical Capabilities research, giving it outsized influence in enterprise buying.

**Analyst Reports:**

Digital transformation, remote work and cloud adoption drive WAN edge infrastructure choices for infrastructure and operations leaders, who should select SD-WAN solutions and SASE deployments to connect enterprise sites and applications.

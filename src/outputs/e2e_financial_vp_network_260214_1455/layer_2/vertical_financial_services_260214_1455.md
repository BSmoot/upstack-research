# **FINANCIAL SERVICES VERTICAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT**
## Infrastructure Advisory Market Adaptation Analysis
**Research Date:** February 14, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY FINDINGS

Financial firms are reallocating IT dollars toward areas that protect confidence and continuity, with nearly 78% of financial firms reporting increased IT and cybersecurity spending over the past 12 months. This transformation creates a **structurally different advisory requirement** than general B2B markets:

1. **Regulatory Complexity Creates Persistent Advisory Need** —

Financial services procurement faces higher scrutiny on data protection and security, with consequences of non-compliance typically more severe, and regulators treating third-party vendor compliance as the institution's own violation. This drives continuous vendor advisory.

2. **Vendor Consolidation Paradox** —

Three core providers dominate the market for core banking systems, with these providers also having large presences in vertically related markets including payment processing and banking-as-a-service, making it difficult for depository institutions to switch providers. Advisory is critical for lock-in risk mitigation.

3. **Compliance-Driven Infrastructure Investment** —

Half of financial firms still rely on outdated or on-premises systems, with over 40% of firms dedicating at least 10% of total budgets to IT and cybersecurity. Regulatory compliance is the primary infrastructure driver, not cost or innovation.

4. **Third-Party Risk Management is Non-Delegable** —

Regulators don't differentiate between third-party vendor compliance and the compliance of financial institutions themselves, raising the stakes on supplier management. This creates structural demand for independent vendor advisory.

5. **Trust and Reputation Risk Eclipse Cost** —

88% of executives say a successful cyberattack would trigger client withdrawals, investor panic, or direct loss of assets, with that figure rising to 94% among CFOs. Vendor selection is a reputational/existential decision, not an efficiency decision.

6. **Multi-Cloud Complexity Creates Advisory Burden** —

Regulators encourage multicloud approaches but also warn against "vendor lock-in," and the European Banking Authority warns against "a dominant service provider that is not easily substitutable". Portfolio-level vendor management is now regulatory-mandated.

7. **Procurement Process Length & Rigor are Industry-Unique** —

Regulators demand detailed due diligence processes in advance of partnerships, including evaluation of compliance experience, program management expertise, and risk management practices. Financial Services procurement cycles are typically 90-180 days for critical infrastructure.

## VERTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LANDSCAPE

### **Infrastructure Spending Profile**

Global enterprise IT spending in the banking and investment services market is forecast to increase by 7.8% in 2025 to $760 billion, with a five-year CAGR of 8.7% expected to exceed $1.1 trillion by 2029.

In 2026, the financial services sector will spend nearly half a trillion dollars on technology, accounting for 17.1% of total US tech spending, with firms increasing spend faster than the market average.

**Spend Distribution:**

Nearly 40% of tech spend goes to software, far higher than the US average across industries, with staffing, consulting, systems integration, outsourcing, telecommunications, and hardware rounding out the rest

Applications now account for 60% of total IT expenditures in 2022, compared with 38% for infrastructure

IT Services is the largest category for Financial Services buyers at $309 billion (44% of market), with 30% on Software, 15% on Hardware, and 11% on Communications

### **Critical Infrastructure Categories**

**Cloud Infrastructure:**

Global spending by financial services companies on cloud computing was $93.2bn in 2023 and will grow to $205 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 17%.

Hybrid cloud models dominate, with 68% of financial institutions leveraging them to balance security and operational flexibility.

Cloud infrastructure now hosts 48% of all financial services workloads, while on-premises systems continue to support 52%.

**Core Banking Systems:**

Three core providers dominate the market for core banking systems for depository institutions, with these providers also having large presences in payment processing, card networks, and banking-as-a-service.

**Cybersecurity Infrastructure:**

Nearly 78% of financial firms report increasing IT and cybersecurity spending, with 93% experiencing at least one cyber incident in the past year, and nearly one in five facing dozens.

### **Technology Decision Classification**

## VERTICAL REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### **Primary Regulatory Framework**

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions to protect the confidentiality of customer information and provide privacy notices explaining how personal data is used.

Both SOX and PCI DSS require high availability of financial and transaction systems, with any downtime potentially disrupting operations, delaying financial reporting, and increasing the risk of non-compliance.

**Key Regulatory Bodies:**

The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) cybersecurity mandate requires financial institutions operating in New York to establish a robust cybersecurity plan, maintain a risk management strategy, and continuously assess their cyber risk profile

All federally supervised financial institutions, including their subsidiaries, must comply with FFIEC regulations

The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is a European Union regulation that establishes uniform requirements for ICT risk management, incident reporting, and oversight of third-party service providers

### **Compliance Impact on Infrastructure Procurement**

Compliance with regulations demands substantial IT infrastructure, as firms must implement systems that allow them to monitor transactions, report accurately, and maintain data integrity, with regulatory authorities introducing new mandates for transparency, risk management, and consumer protection.

GLBA explicitly requires financial institutions to ensure that third-party service providers maintain adequate data protection controls, including data protection obligations in vendor contracts and evaluating vendors' security practices before engagement.

Bank CISOs report spending 30–50% of their time on compliance and examiner management, with their teams spending nearly 70% of their hours on compliance tasks rather than on defense.

## VERTICAL BUYING PROCESS ANALYSIS

### **Decision Structure**

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Chief Information Officer (technology strategy alignment)
- Chief Risk Officer / Chief Information Security Officer (compliance/risk evaluation)
- Chief Financial Officer or VP Finance (budgeting & ROI)
- Procurement / Vendor Management (due diligence execution)
- Compliance & Legal Teams (regulatory alignment)
- Board of Directors (for critical systems over certain spending thresholds)

Before working with a vendor, banks need to assess whether the third party aligns with their business goals and risk tolerance, considering how critical the vendor's service is to daily operations.

### **Procurement Process Timeline**

**Typical Financial Services Infrastructure Procurement Cycle:**

The regulatory guidance outlines five phases in managing third-party relationships: planning, due diligence and selection, contract negotiation, ongoing monitoring, and termination.

**Phase Duration Estimates:**
1. **Planning** (2-4 weeks): Business case development, requirements definition, stakeholder alignment
2. **Due Diligence & Selection** (4-8 weeks): RFI/RFP issuance, vendor evaluation, site visits
3. **Contract Negotiation** (3-6 weeks): Terms negotiation, security requirements finalization
4. **Implementation/Onboarding** (8-16 weeks): Vendor onboarding, system integration, compliance validation
5. **Total Cycle:** 90-180 days for infrastructure decisions

A vendor supporting a critical activity will require more detailed planning than vendors providing simple services, requiring the bank to understand the strategic purpose, identify risks, assess cost/benefit, understand information security implications, and assess ability to monitor risks.

### **Procurement Trigger Events**

- **Regulatory Mandate:** New compliance requirements (SOX, GLBA, NYDFS, DORA updates)
- **Legacy System Sunset:** End-of-life core systems or infrastructure
- **Risk Event:** Cyberattack, operational outage, third-party failure
- **Strategic Initiative:** Digital transformation, cloud migration, API enablement
- **Contract Renewal:** Annual review cycles for critical services
- **Vendor Consolidation:** Acquisition, exit, or financial distress of existing vendor
- **Capacity/Performance:** Business growth requiring infrastructure scaling

## VERTICAL PAIN POINT ANALYSIS — TOP 5

### **1. Vendor Lock-In & Concentration Risk (Most Acute)**

Industry leaders and government agencies have expressed concerns about the Big Three core providers' market power, with CFPB Director Rohit Chopra expressing concerns about cost increases, inflexibility, declining services, and unfair contract terms, noting downstream effects on relationship banking and consumers.

Regulators encourage multicloud approaches but warn against relying on just one provider and against dealing with "a dominant service provider that is not easily substitutable".

**Financial Services Specific:** Unlike general B2B, banks face structural switching costs that make vendor consolidation a regulatory issue.

Banks face pressure to show they have multi-cloud strategies, exit plans, and on-premises backups to avoid vendor lock-in and concentration risk.

### **2. Regulatory Compliance Complexity & Cost Burden**

Navigating the complex web of regulations is a critical challenge for procurement teams in the banking industry, with the Basel III standards introducing stringent requirements for capital adequacy, liquidity, and risk management.

This patchwork regulatory framework drains resources from frontline cyber defense and forces firms to prioritize compliance paperwork over real-time resilience.

**Financial Services Specific:** Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable and audit-intensive. The cost of non-compliance (fines, license suspension, board liability) far exceeds the cost of the technology itself.

### **3. Legacy System Modernization with Zero Downtime Requirement**

Leading banks are deploying enterprise-wide AI solutions, yet only a quarter of institutions have data infrastructure capable of supporting them.

Core modernizations remain mired in pitfalls, from cost overruns and delays to underwhelming returns on investments, with less than half of banking CIOs reporting meaningful gains, and some even suffering deterioration in operational capabilities.

**Financial Services Specific:** Unlike most industries, financial services cannot tolerate downtime during infrastructure replacement. Payment processing, loan servicing, and deposit systems must maintain 24/7 availability. This eliminates "rip and replace" strategies and requires parallel-run models that increase costs 30-50%.

### **4. Third-Party Vendor Risk Management Complexity**

In fact, 15% of all data breaches in 2024 involved a third party, which is a 68% increase from 2023.

Data security and access between multiple parties (bank, fintech, technology vendors) can create numerous vulnerabilities if left unchecked, with banks having a history of protecting sensitive customer information but lacking experience monitoring cybersecurity practices for fintechs.

**Financial Services Specific:**

Regulators treat any lapse in a vendor's compliance as your own violation, raising the stakes on supplier management. Ongoing monitoring burden is substantially higher than other industries.

### **5. Talent Shortage for Infrastructure Modernization**

Deloitte says 64% of financial organizations plan to add more technical skills in fiscal 2025-2026, with priorities including AI and automation, data analysis, and technology integration, and AI-related job postings up 25% since 2022.

For IT departments, the talent shortage means doing more with less while environments get more complex, with automation, intuitive tools, and solutions that don't require deep expertise for basic monitoring and troubleshooting becoming necessary.

**Financial Services Specific:** Unlike general tech, Financial Services also faces regulatory expertise gaps. Banks need employees who understand both cloud architecture AND SOX/PCI compliance. This compounds the talent problem.

## VERTICAL COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

### **Dominant Infrastructure Vendors**

**Core Banking (Oligopoly):**

The top 10 vendors are Microsoft, FIS Global, SAP, Oracle, Temenos, Fiserv, Jack Henry & Associates, NCR, SS&C Technologies, and ICE Mortgage Technology, collectively capturing 41.1% of the market.

FIS has topped the Everest Group Leading 50™ Core Banking Technology Providers 2024 ranking, with recognition for its comprehensive coverage across all core banking modules, strong industry partnerships, and significant presence in serving the credit union segment.

**Cloud Services:**

The three largest cloud companies – Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, and Google Cloud Platform – are leading the pack in this category, with AWS having by far the largest customer base at 61,115 Financial Services customers, more than three times that of the next highest vendor.

**Cybersecurity:**

Cybersecurity solutions represent a major area of IT spending, given the rising frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks targeting financial institutions.

### **Vertical-Specific Advisory Firms**

Celent is recognized as a research, advisory, and consulting firm focused on technology for financial services, with coverage encompassing Capital Markets, Life & Health Insurance, Retail Banking, and Wealth & Asset Management.

One of Celent's main differentiators is VendorMatch, the firm's vendor discovery and shortlisting tool that covers technology in Celent's coverage areas.

**Specialty Advisory Firms:**

Arriba Advisors leverages more than 200 years of cumulative fintech industry experience and has managed more than 600 core evaluations to identify vendors that best enable the strategic goals of financial institutions

Many financial institutions are hemorrhaging money and missed opportunities due to incomplete approaches to vendor management, making the differentiation between vendor selection as purely compliance vs. actively managing vendor performance for competitive advantage

### **Vendor Selection Criteria (Financial Services-Specific)**

Evaluation criteria include compatibility of the service provider's vision/value proposition, ability to execute the vision, functionality of the service/system, technology type and power, and service/support in terms of maintenance hours, response time, resolution time, security, and disaster planning.

**Compliance & Risk Assessment (Heightened in FS):**

Verify the vendor's certifications such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, or GDPR compliance, and evaluate the third party's cybersecurity infrastructure and data privacy practices, including encryption, network security, incident response capabilities, and privacy policies.

## VERTICAL VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK

### **How UPSTACK's Value Proposition Adapts for Financial Services**

**Baseline Horizontal Positioning:** UPSTACK positions as eliminating the "vendor lifecycle management gap" where technology vendors operate without oversight between procurement events.

**Financial Services Adaptation:** This positioning becomes **existentially higher stakes**. Vendor management is not a cost optimization play—it's a regulatory compliance mandate and reputational risk mitigation strategy.

**Reframed Value Drivers:**

| Dimension | General B2B | Financial Services |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Primary Driver** | Cost efficiency & performance | Regulatory compliance + risk mitigation + cost |
| **Procurement Frequency** | Episodic (3-5 year cycles) | Continuous (ongoing monitoring mandate) |
| **Stakeholder Buy-In** | IT/Procurement | Risk/Compliance + Board involvement |
| **ROI Metrics** | Cost reduction, uptime | Risk reduction, compliance pass, audit success |
| **Trust Model Importance** | High | **Critical** (reputational/existential) |

**Financial Services-Specific Value Articulation:**

**Do NOT:** "UPSTACK helps you negotiate better IT contracts and manage your vendor relationships more efficiently."

**DO:**
"Between regulatory exams, your vendor relationships operate without the oversight, accountability, and risk documentation regulators now mandate. That's where compliance risk lives. Financial Services vendor management is a regulatory discipline most financial institutions don't have and all of them need. UPSTACK is where it lives."

### **Vertical-Specific Proof Points Needed**

1. **Regulatory Exam Success:** "In the past 12 months, X% of UPSTACK Financial Services clients passed compliance exams with zero vendor management findings, compared to Y% industry average"
2. **Vendor Lock-In Mitigation:** "Helped X banks reduce infrastructure concentration risk through multi-cloud strategy execution"
3. **Compliance Timeline:** "Enabled X credit unions to meet DORA/NYDFS requirements within required timeframes"
4. **Third-Party Breach Prevention:** "Zero data breaches attributed to vendor mismanagement among UPSTACK FS clients"
5. **Board Presentation Ready:** Case studies that translate to CFO/CRO/Board language, not just IT language

### **Common Objections (Financial Services-Specific)**

**Objection 1:** "Our compliance and risk teams already manage vendor relationships"
**Response:** "Compliance teams ensure *regulatory adherence*, but they don't provide the technical vendor evaluation, negotiation, or lifecycle management that the FDIC/Fed guidance requires. Most banks have compliance *monitoring* but not vendor *advisory*. That's the gap UPSTACK fills."

**Objection 2:** "We already use a Big 4 consulting firm for IT strategy"
**Response:** "Strategy consultants recommend *what* to buy. UPSTACK evaluates *which vendor* to buy, manages the *how* (negotiation, terms, SLAs), and stays through the *lifecycle*. These are complementary, not competitive."

**Objection 3:** "Our RFP process is already rigorous"
**Response:** "RFPs create short-term evaluation clarity but don't solve ongoing vendor management. After the contract is signed, most banks operate vendor relationships on a purely transactional basis until the next crisis or contract renewal. That's where the regulatory risk lives."

## RESEARCH GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATION

### **Critical Gaps**

1. **Vendor-Reimbursed Model Acceptance in FS** (Confidence: 45%)
   - *Gap:* No data on how Financial Services CROs/Compliance officers perceive commission-based advisory model
   - *Recommendation:* Conduct 10-15 interviews with Chief Risk Officers at mid-sized banks ($5-50B AUM) on compensation model transparency preferences
   - *Impact:* Could materially affect positioning if regulatory/compliance mindset views commission model as conflict-of-interest

2. **Market Size for Infrastructure Advisory in FS** (Confidence: 40%)
   - *Gap:* No vendor analyst reports on dedicated infrastructure advisory TAM in financial services
   - *Recommendation:* Calculate addressable market via: (# of banks with $500M+ assets) × (% with formal vendor management function) × (average advisory budget)
   - *Impact:* Needed to assess addressable TAM and justify GTM investment

3. **Advisory Engagement Timeline in FS** (Confidence: 60%)
   - *Gap:* Data on general procurement timelines exists, but no specific data on IT infrastructure advisory engagement duration/depth
   - *Recommendation:* Benchmark against Cornerstone Advisors, Arriba case studies to understand engagement length and typical customer journey
   - *Impact:* Affects sales cycle and customer acquisition cost modeling

4. **Regulatory Exam Specificity** (Confidence: 70%)
   - *Gap:* FDIC/OCC guidance is clear on expectations, but limited data on what examiners *actually* look for in vendor management files
   - *Recommendation:* Conduct interviews with regulatory examiners or compliance consultants who work through exams
   - *Impact:* Could sharpen value prop if we can articulate "what passes an exam" vs. "what regulators want"

### **Forward Research Priorities**

1. **Third-party risk management competitive landscape** — Who else is positioning vendor advisory to Financial Services? What are they saying?
2. **Buy vs. build vs. outsource** decision framework for financial institutions — When do banks decide to use external advisors vs. build internal capability?
3. **Fintech partnership success/failure patterns** — How does vendor advisory improve fintech partnership outcomes?
4. **Regional bank vs. large bank differences** — Do small ($500M-$5B) and large ($5B+) institutions have different vendor management needs?

---

## CONCLUSION

The Financial Services vertical represents a **structurally more attractive market for infrastructure advisory** than general B2B:

- **Regulatory mandate** creates non-discretionary demand for vendor oversight
- **Concentration risk** (Big Three vendors) creates structural lock-in problem
- **Reputational/existential stakes** (vendor breach = bank crisis) elevates vendor selection criticality
- **Board-level governance** requirement creates CFO/CRO sponsorship for advisory
- **Compliance complexity** eliminates one-time engagement model; advisory is continuous

However, market entry requires:
1. **Regulatory credibility** (analyst positioning, compliance consultant partnerships)
2. **FS-specific proof points** (exam success, lock-in reduction, compliance outcomes)
3. **Clarity on compensation model** (commission-based model may face skepticism from risk/compliance buyers)
4. **Vertical-specific messaging** (this is risk/compliance, not cost optimization)

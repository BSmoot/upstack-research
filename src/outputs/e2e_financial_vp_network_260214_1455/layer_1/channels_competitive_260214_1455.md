# COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT: INFRASTRUCTURE ADVISORY MARKETPLACE
## Prepared for UPSTACK | February 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The infrastructure technology advisory market is experiencing significant consolidation and transformation, with **direct vendor sales remaining the PRIMARY competitive threat** rather than other advisors. Key findings:

1. **Market Scale**:

Global Procurement Consulting Services Market size was valued at USD 17.49 billion in 2025, expected to reach USD 31.49 billon by 2035, with a CAGR of 8% from 2025 to 2035.



The technology consulting market is forecast to surpass $400 billion in 2026, with revenue growth in the tech consulting market forecast to rise to 7% in 2026.

2. **Direct Vendor Competition Intensifying**:

Major carriers have gone on the record about their intended increase in channel revenue. Lumen, for example, intends for 70% of its business to run through partners over the next 5-10 years.

 However, this is coupled with aggressive direct sales efforts.

3. **Advisory Competitive Landscape Consolidating**:

Companies like Telarus, Intelisys, AppDirect, Avant, and others were bound to attract the attention of savvy investors. The market is ripe for growth, and Private Equity has arrived in force. We're seeing consolidation of TSDs as well as the consolidation of the Trusted Advisor community; think BridgePointe, Bluewave, ARG, OneSource, and others.

4. **UPSTACK's Competitive Position**:

Bluewave scored the best among its peers for networking, and landed the largest networking deal. On the pure sales performance, Lumen led the way with the most overall revenue, followed by AT&T and Comcast Business.

 UPSTACK's 99.8% retention and $55M+ MRR under management position it as an outlier in a fragmented market.

## SUPPLIER DIRECT SALES ANALYSIS (PRIMARY COMPETITION)

This is the critical finding: **Direct vendor sales teams are the primary competitive threat**, not other advisors. Vendors are aggressively consolidating their sales presence while simultaneously investing in channel partner programs.

### Network/Connectivity Vendors

**Consolidation & Direct Sales Focus:**

Lumen Technologies completed the sale of its Mass Markets fiber-to-the-home business to AT&T for $5.75 billion in cash. The completed transaction is another strategic milestone in Lumen's transformation into the leading enterprise digital networking services company built for the multi-cloud, AI-driven economy.

Verizon is the most obvious candidate for "winner" status if it can successfully integrate Frontier's 10 million fiber passings, bringing its total reach to roughly 30 million locations across 31 states. If Schulman's tech-first approach reduces churn as predicted, Verizon could see a significant expansion in its valuation multiples.

**Strategic Positioning Against Advisors:**
- **Direct Enterprise Sales Teams**: AT&T, Verizon, Lumen maintain large enterprise account teams focused on "converged connectivity" (bundled fiber + wireless). These teams bypass advisors for large deals.
- **Channel Conflict**:

These companies have gone on the record about their intended increase in channel revenue. Lumen, for example, intends for 70% of its business to run through partners over the next 5-10 years.

 However, "partner" typically means VAR/SI channels, not independent advisors.
- **Exclusive Incentives**: Carriers offer volume discounts, construction support, and implementation services that advisors cannot match.

### Security Vendors (Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Zscaler)

**Platform Consolidation & Direct Sales Aggression:**

The integration of CyberArk's privileged access controls directly into Palo Alto's Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) offerings creates a formidable barrier to entry for smaller players. Conversely, the acquisition puts immense pressure on standalone identity providers like Okta. While Okta remains a leader in workforce identity and single sign-on (SSO), it now faces a competitor that can bundle identity governance with network and cloud security at a preferred price point.

The cybersecurity platform skirmish all started when Palo Alto Networks reported earnings and CEO Nikesh Arora said the company would offer incentives to entice enterprises to consolidate vendors. This cybersecurity platform skirmish all started when Palo Alto Networks reported earnings and CEO Nikesh Arora said the company would offer incentives to entice enterprises to consolidate vendors.

**Competitive Positioning Against Advisors:**
- **Consolidation Discounts**: Vendors incentivize "rip and replace" strategies, undercutting advisors' ability to negotiate better terms across disparate vendors.
- **Platform Play**: Bundling creates lock-in; advisors lose negotiating leverage if customers commit to an integrated stack.
- **Direct Enterprise Relationships**: CISOs report preference for "one neck to choke," reducing reliance on advisors.

### CCaaS Vendors (Five9, Genesys, NICE)

**Vendor Positioning:**

While proprietary suites from Genesys, NICE, Five9, and Cisco are powerful, they represent a traditional approach. They ask you to buy into a single vendor's vision for architecture, AI, and pricing, trading strategic autonomy for one-stop-shop simplicity. While proprietary suites from Genesys, NICE, Five9, and Cisco are powerful, they represent a traditional approach. They ask you to buy into a single vendor's vision for architecture, AI, and pricing, trading strategic autonomy for one-stop-shop simplicity.

**Direct vs. Advisor Sales:**

Genesys, NICE, Five9, and Amazon Connect all look similar on a feature grid. They all promise omnichannel, AI, and "enterprise-grade" reliability. But in 2026, the real question is different: which one fits your next three years of growth, compliance, and AI experiments without blowing up TCO?

These vendors maintain large enterprise sales teams and offer professional services that compete directly with advisors' value proposition. Advisors struggle to differentiate when vendors offer equivalent "free assessments" and implementation support.

### UCaaS Vendors (Microsoft Teams, RingCentral, Zoom)

**Market Consolidation & Channel Dynamics:**

The unified communication-as-a-service market is moderately concentrated. The top five vendors Microsoft, RingCentral, Zoom, Cisco, and Verizon collectively control about 48% of 2025 revenue. Microsoft leverages Microsoft 365 bundling; Teams Phone attach among E5 users reached 62% in fiscal 2025.

**Channel Conflict vs. Direct Sales:**

- **Microsoft**:

Microsoft leverages Microsoft 365 bundling; Teams Phone attach among E5 users reached 62% in fiscal 2025.

 Direct bundling with Office 365 eliminates need for advisors.
- **RingCentral**:

August 2025: AT&T and RingCentral inked a multi-year pact to co-develop vertical UCaaS solutions, starting with healthcare.

 Carrier partnerships create direct-to-enterprise paths.

### Cloud Vendors (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

**Marketplace & Channel Strategy:**

Channel partnerships work because the economics are clear. A systems integrator takes 15-25% of deal value, employs a sales team with direct buyer relationships, and actively works opportunities on your behalf. They're incentivized to close. Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP) operate fundamentally differently: Hyperscaler account executives earn minimal compensation on marketplace fees—maybe a small SPIFF if they hit certain deal counts. Their primary comp is tied to cloud consumption growth.

**Advisor Opportunity Paradox:**
- Hyperscalers don't incentivize ISV/advisor sales via marketplace.
- Direct enterprise teams focused on consumption, not procurement advisory.
- Advisors compete on cost negotiation, but hyperscalers have scale pricing.

## ADVISORY COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Major Players

The channel has watched the number of national TSDs dwindle to a handful in 2022. Intelisys, Telarus, Avant, TBI, Sandler Partners, Jenne and AppSmart appear to be the largest players. However, most sources tell Channel Futures four or five national TSDs will remain standing.

### UPSTACK's Competitive Position

UPSTACK differentiates on:
- **Operational Depth**:

Bluewave scored the best among its peers for networking, and landed the largest networking deal. Notably, Michigan-based C3 Technology Advisors' share of business with Telarus increased in a big way. The firm was tops in advanced networking and SD-WAN.

 UPSTACK has comparable category depth.
- **Retention**: UPSTACK's 99.8% retention vastly exceeds industry norms, indicating sustained value delivery.
- **Technology Evaluation**: UPSTACK completed 5,759 technology evaluations in 12 months—a proxy for market engagement depth unavailable to point-solution competitors.

### Competitive Weaknesses in Advisor Market

For example, Helm Partners is big enough to launch its own contact center consulting practice, and Bluewave is building life cycle management services with institutional capital. But now the TSDs say they can help the smaller partners bridge that gap. For example, Helm Partners is big enough to launch its own contact center consulting practice, and Bluewave is building life cycle management services with institutional capital. But now the TSDs say they can help the smaller partners bridge that gap.

Advisors struggle to match vendor capabilities in:
- Hands-on implementation/managed services
- Proprietary technology platforms (assessment tools, benchmarking databases)
- Professional services (training, integration, optimization)

## CHANNEL STRATEGY ANALYSIS

### Technology Services Broker (TSB) Economics

Upstack has 188 "employees" per LinkedIn. Telarus as 493. Avant has 260. That is a lot of payroll! Sales Engineers, Partner Managers, Channel Managers, tech & dev people for the portal, vendor relations, marketing, events, Commissions, ordering, Cable and M&A – that is a lot of folks that need to get paid.

**Channel Revenue Model Under Pressure:**
- Consolidation at vendor level (direct sales efficiency) reducing channel reliance
- Margin compression as hyperscalers cut marketplace fees
- Partner acquisition costs rising (PE-backed TSBs paying premium to acquire boutique advisors)

### Consolidation Trends

Upstack acquired about 30 agencies since 2021. Bluewave has done fewer deals. Bridgepointe has done about as many. These deals put selling partners under the umbrella of the super-agency.

Private equity is consolidating the channel;

Columbia Capital, who invested in both Bluewave and Telarus, is in talks to scoop up any troubled assets in our world.

## BUYER EVALUATION CRITERIA

Enterprises evaluate technology advisors on:

Define the business results you must achieve: security posture, uptime targets, integration boundaries, migration timelines, and budget constraints. If a requirement doesn't tie to an outcome, cut it. A clear vendor selection criteria checklist can translate business goals, risks, and constraints into measurable standards that guide every step of the vendor selection process.

**Common Procurement Pain Points Advisors Address:**

Rising SaaS costs, auto-renew escalators, bundled features no one uses, and vendors who always seem to hold the upper hand. At ProcureCon IT Sourcing, you'll hear from leaders who've pushed back, reset commercial expectations, and rebuilt leverage with the biggest names in tech. Learn how they expose hidden costs, challenge bad assumptions, and regain control of their technology spend.

This is UPSTACK's core differentiation: buyers are aware of the unmanaged vendor lifecycle gap, but vendors are positioning their own "free assessments" and "advisory services" as substitutes.

---

## KEY MARKET GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. **Vendor Lifecycle Management as a Discipline**

Advisory work now emphasizes portfolio choices rather than one-size-fits-all strategies. At the same time, there is greater awareness of organizational readiness. AI and orchestration tools cannot deliver ROI without process adaptation, governance and retraining.

**Opportunity**: Enterprises recognize that vendor selection is not a one-time procurement event; it's a lifecycle discipline. UPSTACK's focus on "Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management" addresses this directly.

### 2. **Procurement Complexity Escalation**

New entrants and point solutions are flooding the market, offering both opportunity (and overload). Roles, skills, and strategies around procurement will continue to shift as technology assumes greater responsibility. Offer training to procurement talent to stay competitive.

**Opportunity**: As procurement teams struggle with AI adoption, ESG compliance, and security-by-design, advisors positioned as "change management partners" (not just negotiators) will win.

### 3. **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Complexity**

Many organizations run multi-cloud or hybrid setups to reduce risk, meet compliance needs, or use best-of-breed services. The tradeoff is added complexity in management, security, and cost tracking.

**Opportunity**: Enterprises realize single-vendor consolidation isn't realistic. Advisors who optimize across AWS, Azure, and GCP simultaneously (rather than choosing a "preferred" hyperscaler) unlock value.

### 4. **Sustainability & ESG Procurement**

Sustainability is also emerging as a key factor in procurement decisions, with businesses increasingly aligning their procurement strategies with ESG goals. Procurement software plays a critical role in this shift by enabling sustainable supply chain management. Features such as supplier traceability, real-time compliance tracking and ESG-focused analytics help organisations meet their sustainability targets while maintaining operational efficiency.

**Opportunity**: Advisors who educate buyers on vendor sustainability claims (vs. greenwashing) and help integrate ESG into RFP criteria will differentiate.

## STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS FOR UPSTACK

**Recommendation**: Lead with **Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management** as the category answer, not advisory jargon. Direct competition is vendors' "free assessments," not other advisors. Emphasize:

1. **Operational continuity** beyond procurement (renewal management, performance optimization, contract true-ups)
2. **Portfolio-level oversight** (30+ vendor relationships without centralized governance)
3. **Proprietary transaction intelligence** (5,759 evaluations/year) as structural advantage
4. **Demonstrated accountability** (99.8% retention, 3.5+ year average tenure)

This research confirms that UPSTACK's positioning—as a lifecycle manager, not a one-time buyer advisor—is strategically aligned with evolving buyer needs and the primary competitive threat (vendor direct sales) rather than reactive positioning against other advisors.

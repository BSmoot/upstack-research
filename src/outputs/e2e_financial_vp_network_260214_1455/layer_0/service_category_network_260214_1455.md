# NETWORK & CONNECTIVITY CATEGORY INTELLIGENCE REPORT
## Comprehensive Buyer Research & Market Analysis (February 2026)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 Key Findings

Organizations across sectors face critical pain points: insufficient bandwidth, unreliable internet connectivity, and inconsistent performance that hinder digital strategies and prevent effective business operations. Key intelligence below:

1. **Market Transformation in Progress**:

SD-WAN has transitioned from an emerging technology to a standard product in enterprise portfolios, with survey data indicating an adoption rate of approximately 75%, yet

MPLS is not disappearing—many enterprises are maintaining a blend, using SD-WAN for scale and cloud reach while retaining MPLS where deterministic delivery is non-negotiable, with both operating in hybrid mode.

2. **Explosive SD-WAN Market Growth**:

Global SD-WAN spend is estimated around $9 B in 2025, on track to reach $35+ B by 2030, fueled by cloud migration and the hybrid work boom—businesses need better networks, and they need them fast.

3. **SASE as the Integration Driver**:

SASE has been growing at a solid double-digit rate, and in 2026, security and networking teams are budgeting less for discrete "boxes" at the branch and more for recurring spend on SASE/SSE, with physical access routers and appliance SWGs continuing to shrink as the edge becomes a service, not a rack of gear.

4. **FWA Reshaping Connectivity**:

As of Q3 2025, 12% of U.S. internet households use 5G or LTE home internet, up from 8% in 2023, and in the first half of 2025 alone, fixed wireless subscribers grew by an impressive 18% compared to 3% growth for fiber-to-the-home subscribers.

5. **Buyer Complexity Escalating**:

Nearly three-quarters of buying teams hire consultants or analysts to help with purchasing decisions, organizations using external advisors see longer cycles (13.6 vs 6.5 months) and larger buying groups (12.9 vs 6.4 people), with buyers now being more experienced and networked, and influence moving toward informal networks and tech stack fit.

6. **Supplier Consolidation Reshaping Competition**:

AT&T agreed to acquire substantially all of Lumen's Mass Markets fiber internet connectivity business—about 1 million fiber customers—in a $5.75 billion deal expected to close in H1 2026, with Verizon's $20 billion Frontier deal also boosting competitive fiber expansion.

7. **Cloud Direct Connects Critical for Multicloud**:

AWS announced preview of AWS Interconnect—multicloud, providing simple, resilient, high-speed private connections to other cloud service providers, enabling customers to quickly establish private, secure, high-speed network connections with dedicated bandwidth and built-in resiliency between their Amazon VPCs and other cloud environments in minutes instead of weeks or months.

## BUYER DISCOVERY PATTERNS

### How Buyers Recognize Network & Connectivity Needs

Organizations often recognize a gap in their operations or a new opportunity, which triggers the start of the B2B buyer journey from factors such as market changes, internal developments, or competition, with stakeholders typically conducting internal assessments to pinpoint specific needs.

**Primary Pain Point Triggers:**

Insufficient bandwidth causes productivity decline as workers wait to send or access files—when an employee is diverted from an active work project, it takes an average of 25 minutes to refocus on their prior task, with the average cost of downtime across all industries now about $9,000 per minute, up to $16,000 per minute for larger businesses.

Significant pain points include timely resolution of internet connectivity issues, with service alternatives that do not offer SLAs keeping clients waiting days for repairs, and delayed service resulting from partnering with more than one provider, as some organizations have cobbled together multiple internet connections from various service providers.

Common concerns include inconsistent download speeds that drop at crucial moments, often due to sharing access with other buildings in their area during peak times, causing dips in internet speeds and connectivity.

### Where & How Buyers Research Solutions

The key trend: buyers trust their peers and their own eyes more than anything else.

**Research Channels (Ranked by Buyer Preference):**

1. **Peer Networks & Word-of-Mouth**:

58% of executives rely on their networks to recommend tools, and they value that input above all else—if enough peers recommend a tool, it's gonna earn a spot in the final 3.

2. **Search Engines & Reviews**:

Buyers use Google and recommendations from friends for initial research, with brand needing to be findable when customers are googling the category, and how you show up on G2, Trustradius, and other third-party review sites mattering, as reputation is everything.

3. **Interactive Demos & Trials**:

82% use interactive demos or other virtual ways of checking out the tool to decide if they like it, with 49% reporting that the actual demo adds the most value in the sales process—more than interactive demos, trials, reviews or the marketing website.

4. **Sales Interactions**:

When 4 out of every five buyers are talking to your sales rep, the pitch matters.

Organizations typically harness vendor websites, industry reports, whitepapers, and case studies, with networking with peers at industry events also providing insights, often leading to consideration of multiple vendors and product options.

# **UPSTACK ABM PLAYBOOK: FINANCIAL SERVICES IT OPERATIONS**
## Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management for VP IT, Director IT, IT Manager

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Financial Services IT Operations professionals face a perfect storm of challenges in 2026:

facing relentless cyber threats, escalating regulatory scrutiny, and rising client expectations, financial firms are reallocating IT dollars toward areas that protect confidence and continuity. Meanwhile,

65% of firms still manage IT and security entirely in-house, creating resource strain on already overwhelmed IT teams.

**Top 3 Combined Pain Points:**
1. **Vendor Sprawl Without Oversight**:

Financial institutions often manage fragmented vendor ecosystems that span global suppliers and even extend into 4th and Nth parties, making oversight complex

2. **Compliance Burden Multiplying**:

Vendors and service providers now fall directly under scrutiny, with institutions held accountable for ensuring compliance. The consequences of failing to meet these obligations are steep, ranging from fines to reputational damage

3. **Firefighting Mode vs. Strategic Focus**: IT teams trapped in reactive vendor management while

financial firms are moving away from static IT budgets and toward active value management

**Key Success Factors:**
- Position advisory as operational resilience enabler, not cost optimization
- Lead with regulatory compliance gaps and vendor accountability risks
- Frame as immediate resource augmentation for overwhelmed internal teams

## **TARGET PROFILE**

### **Vertical Context: Financial Services**
**Industry Dynamics:**

Nearly 78% of financial firms report increasing IT and cybersecurity spending over the past 12 months

85% of US banking institutions are still using legacy systems

Financial services industry experiencing cyberattacks 300 times more frequently than other sectors

**Regulatory Environment:**
- **DORA Compliance**:

The EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is changing the way financial institutions manage not only their internal systems but also the risks posed by their vendors... success under DORA requires embedding vendor risk management into daily operations rather than treating it as a periodic compliance exercise

- **Key Regulations**: SOX, PCI-DSS, GLBA, FFIEC, DORA
- **Rising Stakes**:

Unplanned downtime costs financial institutions approximately $500,000 per hour

**Technology Priorities:**

AI is the largest investment priority for 2026

2026 investments in cloud and infrastructure modernization reflect a recognition that legacy systems are now a liability. Modern platforms support centralized visibility, faster recovery, and stronger built-in security

### **Title Context: IT Operations (VP IT, Director IT, IT Manager)**
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Vendor relationship management across 15-40+ technology vendors
- Infrastructure reliability and uptime maintenance
- Compliance monitoring and audit readiness
- Team resource allocation and firefighting coordination

**Decision Authority:**
- **VP IT**: Strategic influence, budget recommendations ($500K+)
- **Director IT**: Tactical execution, vendor evaluation leadership ($100K-500K)
- **IT Manager**: Day-to-day vendor management, implementation oversight ($50K-100K)

**Resource Constraints:**

Talent shortages and operational complexity are also reshaping spend

Resource constraints also play a role, compliance teams are tasked with meeting new DORA requirements while innovation and growth remain high priorities

- Teams spending 60-70% time on firefighting vs. strategic initiatives

### **Combined Profile: Financial Services IT Operations**
**Decision Authority**: Tactical decisions with strategic influence; budget thresholds $50K-$500K+ depending on level
**Budget Cycles**: Q1 planning, Q3 renewals, emergency procurement as needed
**Primary Pain Points (Ranked):**
1. **Regulatory Vendor Accountability Gap** - New compliance requirements without resources
2. **Multi-Vendor Coordination Chaos** - 20-30+ vendors, each with different processes
3. **Reactive vs. Proactive Operations** - Firefighting prevents strategic vendor lifecycle management
4. **Legacy Integration Complexity** -

Many banks still rely on legacy systems that are outdated and difficult to integrate with new technologies... Managing and modernizing legacy infrastructure while ensuring continuity of services is a significant challenge

5. **Resource Allocation Pressure** - Internal teams stretched across too many vendor relationships

## **MESSAGING FRAMEWORK**

### **Value Proposition (Financial Services IT Operations Specific)**
**Primary**: Your IT team manages 20-30+ vendor relationships without portfolio-level oversight — while regulators now hold you directly accountable for every supplier's operational resilience and compliance failures.

**Supporting Points:**
- **Regulatory Shield**: Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management ensures continuous DORA, SOX, and PCI compliance monitoring across your entire supplier ecosystem
- **Operational Resilience**: Proactive vendor performance management prevents the $500K/hour downtime costs that cripple financial institutions
- **Resource Multiplication**: Senior advisory expertise funded by vendors, extending your team's capabilities without headcount or budget impact
- **Strategic Enablement**: Move from firefighting vendor issues to strategic infrastructure modernization and innovation focus

### **Key Messages (Ranked by Resonance)**

1. **Compliance Accountability Message**:
*"Between procurement events, your 25+ technology vendors operate without compliance oversight — but DORA and SOX regulations hold you fully accountable for their failures. One client was facing potential regulatory action because a terminated vendor relationship had never been properly documented for audit trails."*

2. **Resource Constraint Message**:
*"Your team manages 30 vendor relationships, each with its own portal, billing format, support queue, and renewal timeline — while also trying to modernize legacy systems and prevent security incidents. The math doesn't work without systematic vendor lifecycle management."*

3. **Operational Resilience Message**:
*"Financial institutions pay $500K per hour for unplanned downtime, yet most have no proactive monitoring of vendor SLA compliance or performance degradation signals. We caught a client's connectivity degradation 6 weeks before it would have caused a trading floor outage."*

### **Proof Points (Financial Services IT Operations Relevant)**

1. **Retention Proof**: "99.8% client retention rate across 2020-2025 cohorts demonstrates that our ongoing vendor lifecycle management creates measurable operational value for IT teams"

2. **Speed Proof**: "Average 33-day evaluation-to-decision timeline — critical when your compliance audit is 60 days out and you need vendor replacements fast"

3. **Scale Proof**: "5,399 active client relationships managing $55M+ in technology spend gives us market intelligence your individual vendor negotiations can't match"

## **OUTBOUND SEQUENCE**

### **Touch 1: Email (Compliance Trigger)**
**Subject**: DORA vendor accountability: 90-day compliance gap assessment

**Body**:
Hi [FirstName],

Financial institutions are now directly accountable for vendor operational resilience under DORA — but most IT teams don't have systematic oversight between procurement events.

A quick question: When was the last time your team audited compliance documentation across all 25+ of your active technology vendor relationships?

One of our clients, a [similar size] bank, discovered they had no audit trail for vendor security certifications going back 18 months. The potential regulatory exposure was significant.

We specialize in Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management — the discipline that fills the gap between procurement events. Would it be worth a 15-minute conversation to discuss how other financial institutions are addressing vendor accountability requirements?

Best regards,
[Name]

P.S. The conversation costs nothing — our advisory is funded by the vendors you ultimately select, never by the client.

### **Touch 2: LinkedIn (Resource Multiplication)**
**Format**: InMail
**Content**:

[FirstName], saw your background managing IT operations at [Company].

Quick question: How does your team maintain oversight across 20-30+ vendor relationships while also handling infrastructure modernization and compliance requirements?

Most IT leaders we work with describe it as "drinking from a fire hose" — especially with new regulatory requirements like DORA holding institutions directly accountable for vendor performance.

Our clients use Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management to extend their team's capabilities. Senior advisory expertise, vendor-funded, focused on the ongoing management your internal team doesn't have bandwidth for.

Worth a brief conversation? I can share how other financial institutions are scaling their vendor oversight without additional headcount.

### **Touch 3: Phone (Direct Problem Focus)**
**Opening**:
"Hi [FirstName], this is [Name] from UPSTACK. I'm calling because financial institutions are facing a new challenge: regulators now hold you directly accountable for vendor operational resilience, but most IT teams don't have systematic oversight between procurement events. Do you have 3 minutes to discuss how this might impact your operations?"

**Discovery Questions**:
- "How many active technology vendor relationships does your team currently manage?"
- "When compliance auditors ask about vendor documentation and performance monitoring, how confident are you in your current process?"
- "What percentage of your team's time would you estimate goes to firefighting vendor issues versus strategic infrastructure planning?"
- "If a critical vendor had performance degradation that could impact trading operations, how quickly would your current monitoring catch it?"

### **Touch 4: Email (Case Study Proof)**
**Subject**: How [Similar Bank] prevents $500K/hour downtime through vendor lifecycle management

**Body**:
[FirstName],

Thought you'd find this relevant: Last month we caught a connectivity provider's performance degradation 6 weeks before it would have caused a critical outage for a client's trading floor.

The problem? Their internal IT team was focused on a major infrastructure project and didn't have bandwidth for proactive vendor monitoring. The potential cost: $500K per hour for financial services downtime.

This is exactly why Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management exists — systematic oversight that prevents vendor-related operational failures while your team focuses on strategic initiatives.

Quick question: What would be the business impact if your most critical connectivity or security vendor had an undetected performance issue for 6 weeks?

Happy to share how we provide this type of ongoing vendor oversight for financial institutions — all vendor-funded, zero cost to your organization.

## **OBJECTION HANDLING**

### **Objection 1: "We have vendor management processes already"**
**Response**: "Most financial institutions do have procurement processes — but there's a gap between purchase and renewal where vendors operate without oversight. For example, when did you last audit whether your 25+ vendors are maintaining the security certifications they promised during procurement? DORA now holds you accountable for ongoing compliance, not just initial selection. We fill that gap with systematic lifecycle management."

### **Objection 2: "Our team can handle vendor relationships internally"**
**Response**: "Absolutely — your team is technically capable. The question is capacity and focus. One client's IT manager was spending 30 hours per week just coordinating vendor support tickets across 20+ suppliers. That's strategic talent being used tactically. Our vendor-funded model lets your team focus on infrastructure modernization while we handle the ongoing vendor coordination and compliance monitoring."

### **Objection 3: "We can't add more vendor relationships to manage"**
**Response**: "That's exactly the problem we solve. We don't add to your vendor count — we reduce your vendor management burden. Instead of managing 25+ vendor relationships individually, you manage one relationship with us, and we coordinate the entire ecosystem. Our clients typically reduce vendor management overhead by 60-70% while improving performance and compliance monitoring."

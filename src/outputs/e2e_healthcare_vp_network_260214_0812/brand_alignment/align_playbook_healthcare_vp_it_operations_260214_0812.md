## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Healthcare IT Operations professionals are caught between impossible demands:

providers are facing IT budget reductions while being asked to optimize existing resources and spend smarter rather than more. Meanwhile,

62% of healthcare provider IT organizations are prioritizing data and analytics technology improvements, and

AI, cybersecurity and workflow automation remain top areas of focus

—all while managing increasingly complex vendor ecosystems.

**The Core Problem:** Between procurement events, your 15-40+ technology vendor relationships operate without oversight, accountability, or advocacy.

Rising cloud complexity is forcing hospitals to adopt stronger FinOps practices and governance to align IT spending with clinical and priorities.

**The UPSTACK Solution:** Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management—a discipline that addresses the structural gap in healthcare IT vendor management through expert advisory, vendor-neutral evaluation, and ongoing relationship optimization. At no cost to you.

**UPSTACK Advisory Perspective:**

UPSTACK serves 1,981 active healthcare client accounts with $890K in MRR under management, with

4.0-year average healthcare client tenure

 proving that ongoing vendor lifecycle management delivers sustained value.

589 closed-won opportunities in trailing 12 months across healthcare clients

 demonstrate active engagement solving the exact vendor management challenges healthcare IT operations face daily.

### **Top 3 Healthcare IT Operations Pain Points**

1. **Vendor Management Burden + Compliance Complexity**: Managing multiple technology vendors while ensuring HIPAA, HITECH, and state privacy law compliance across all relationships
2. **Cost Optimization Under Budget Pressure**:

5% IT budget reductions forcing consolidation of applications and enhanced optimization to ensure every dollar delivers maximum value

3. **Resource Constraints + Strategic Pressure**: Balancing firefighting with strategic initiatives while proving IT's value to clinical outcomes

## **MESSAGING FRAMEWORK**

### **Primary Value Proposition**

*"Your team manages 15-40+ technology vendor relationships across connectivity, cloud, security, and communications—each with different contracts, billing systems, and compliance requirements. Between procurement events, these relationships operate without oversight, accountability, or advocacy. That's where healthcare organizations lose the most money and create the most risk. UPSTACK provides Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management—ongoing expert advisory that optimizes your vendor ecosystem for cost, compliance, and performance. At no cost to you."*

**Trust Model Explanation:** Our fees are reimbursed by the vendor you select — not by you. That sounds unusual, so here's why it works: vendors pay us the same commission they'd pay their own sales team, because we extend their reach to enterprise buyers they'd otherwise need to find on their own. You don't pay more — in most cases, our clients get better pricing and terms than they would going direct, because we bring market intelligence and negotiating leverage from thousands of completed engagements. We earn ongoing compensation only when you stay on a solution, which means our incentive is your long-term satisfaction, not a one-time transaction.

### **Supporting Value Dimensions**

1. **Compliance-Aware Vendor Management**: Every recommendation considers technology assessments informed by healthcare regulatory requirements including HIPAA, HITECH, and state privacy laws
2. **Cost Optimization Under Budget Pressure**: Market intelligence from

5,759 technology evaluations completed and 3,766 deals closed in the trailing 12 months across all service categories

 informs pricing benchmarks and negotiation leverage
3. **Resource Extension**:

248 team members across all technology disciplines, with 47% in leadership roles

 operate as extension of your team
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Due diligence and ongoing monitoring across

322 active supplier relationships with closed deals in the trailing 24 months, from a total network of 1,272 supplier connections

5. **Operational Efficiency**: Single point of contact for all vendor-related needs through

dedicated project management through deployment, coordinating across vendors, tracking milestones, managing escalations

### **Key Messages (Healthcare IT Operations Specific)**

1. **"One client was paying $2,000/month for equipment on circuits disconnected three years ago—nobody caught it because nobody was looking. Your vendor relationships need ongoing oversight, not just procurement events."**

2. **"With 5% budget cuts and increasing compliance requirements, you can't afford vendor relationships operating without accountability. Our vendor lifecycle management extends your team's capabilities at no cost to you."**

3. **"Managing compliance-aware technology evaluation across 20+ technology vendors isn't just complex—it's a moving target. We maintain current knowledge of healthcare regulatory requirements across all major technology categories through

[First Name],

Quick question: Between procurement events, who's monitoring your technology vendor relationships for cost creep, compliance gaps, or performance issues?

Most healthcare IT teams we work with manage 15-40+ vendor relationships—each with different contracts, SLAs, and compliance requirements. The operational burden is real, but the hidden cost is worse.

One of our clients discovered they were paying $2,000/month for equipment on circuits that had been disconnected three years earlier. Nobody caught it because nobody was looking.

Your vendor relationships need ongoing oversight, not just procurement events. That's where Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management comes in.

UPSTACK is a technology advisory firm serving 1,981 active healthcare organizations, with 4.0-year average client tenure proving the value of continuous vendor oversight.

### **Touch 4: Email - Case Study**
**Subject:** How [Similar Health System] optimized vendor costs without changing providers
**Timing:** 1 week after phone attempt

```
[First Name],

Tried reaching you last week about vendor lifecycle management. No worries—I know how busy healthcare IT gets.

Thought you might find this relevant: We recently worked with a similarly sized health system managing 23 technology vendor relationships with no ongoing oversight between renewals.

Their challenges:
- IT budget reduced 5% while compliance requirements increased
- Team spent 40% of time on vendor-related issues
- No visibility into whether they were getting optimal value from existing contracts

Our vendor lifecycle management approach:
- Comprehensive audit of existing vendor relationships through our Discovery & Assessment phase
- Ongoing performance and cost monitoring via our Lifecycle Management process
- Single point of contact for all vendor-related needs
- Compliance-aware technology evaluation across all categories

Results after 12 months:
- Market-informed pricing optimization across their vendor portfolio
- 60% reduction in vendor management burden
- Improved compliance tracking across all audited relationships

The entire engagement cost them nothing—our commission-based, vendor-funded model means our fees are reimbursed by the vendors they select.

As a technology advisory firm serving 1,981 healthcare organizations with 99.8% client retention, we've proven that ongoing vendor lifecycle management delivers sustained value.

Worth 15 minutes to discuss your vendor management approach?

Best,
[Your name]

## **OBJECTION HANDLING**

### **Objection 1: "We don't have budget for advisory services"**
**Response:**
"I understand budget constraints—that's exactly why our model works for healthcare organizations. At no cost to you, vendors fund our advisory fees through our commission-based model the same way they pay their own sales teams. In most cases, our clients get better pricing and terms than going direct because we bring market intelligence from

5,759 technology evaluations completed in the trailing 12 months. Our

99.8% client retention rate

 proves the model works—healthcare organizations stay with us for an average of 4 years because the value far exceeds any perceived cost."

### **Objection 2: "We have good relationships with our current vendors"**
**Response:**
"That's actually ideal. Good vendor relationships are exactly what we help you optimize and protect. The question isn't whether your vendors are good—it's whether you're getting optimal value, performance, and compliance from those relationships over time. Our

99.8% client retention rate

 proves we enhance existing vendor relationships rather than disrupt them. We work with

322 active supplier relationships, so we often help clients negotiate better terms with vendors they want to keep. Our Lifecycle Management phase provides ongoing vendor coordination and strategic account reviews to strengthen those relationships."

### **Objection 3: "We handle vendor management internally"**
**Response:**
"Most healthcare IT teams do handle vendor management—between everything else you're managing. The challenge isn't capability, it's capacity. Your team fights fires while managing strategic initiatives. Meanwhile, each vendor optimizes for their own interests. As a technology advisory firm with

248 team members across all technology disciplines, including

101 advisory and consulting specialists, we provide ongoing advocacy and market intelligence that your internal team simply doesn't have time to develop. Think of us as extending your team's capabilities, not replacing them—at no cost to you through our vendor-funded model."

### **Objection 4: "How do we know your recommendations aren't biased toward vendors who pay you?"**
**Response:**
"Great question—transparency is fundamental to our model. First, we're paid by whichever vendor you select through our commission-based model, not by specific vendors trying to influence our recommendations. We work with

322 active supplier relationships from a total network of 1,272 supplier connections

—no quotas, no exclusive relationships. Second, our

99.8% client retention rate and 4.0-year average healthcare client tenure

 prove our recommendations work—we only succeed when our clients succeed long-term. Third, we disclose our compensation model upfront and provide data-driven scorecards during our Sourcing & Evaluation phase. Happy to show you exactly how our evaluation process works."

### **Objection 5: "We don't have time for another vendor relationship"**
**Response:**
"That's the point—we reduce your vendor management burden, not add to it. Instead of managing 20+ vendor relationships, you have one point of contact that manages all of them on your behalf through our Lifecycle Management process. Our clients typically see a 60% reduction in time spent on vendor-related issues. We handle renewals, performance monitoring, compliance tracking, and escalations through

dedicated project management, coordinating across vendors, tracking milestones, and managing escalations. You get more vendor oversight with less time investment."

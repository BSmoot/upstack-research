# NETWORK & CONNECTIVITY CATEGORY INTELLIGENCE REPORT

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY FINDINGS ON BUYER BEHAVIOR

The global software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) market size is valued at USD 7.87 billion in 2025 and is estimated to reach USD 76.31 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 29.3% during the forecast period, with growth supported by rising adoption of cloud-delivered and service provider SD-WAN solutions, which enhance network agility, reduce dependency on expensive MPLS connections, and enable secure, application-aware connectivity across distributed enterprise environments.

1. **Security and Integration Drive SASE Adoption**:

Single-vendor SASE platform deployments increased 21% year-over-year during the quarter, which analysts tied to enterprises wanting "more straightforward purchasing, tighter policy management, and lower operating costs made possible by tightly integrated next-generation SD-WAN and cloud-security platforms."

 Buyers are shifting from multivendor complexity to unified platforms.

2. **Legacy Infrastructure Modernization Remains Critical**:

Legacy infrastructure and technical debt are daily burdens for many ITDMs, with about 36% of IT resources devoted to maintaining existing environments, leaving fewer resources for innovation, which is a pain point for CIOs wanting to modernize.

3. **Cost-to-Performance Tradeoff Shapes Procurement**:

IT teams must carefully consider all aspects of SD-WAN DIA underlays including support, performance and uptime SLA, and one of the main tenets of SD-WAN marketing revolves around the total cost of ownership cost savings of SD-WAN versus traditional MPLS networks, with most enterprises achieving cost savings by using low-cost internet providers to serve branch office locations.

4. **AI and Infrastructure Capacity Create Urgency**:

Research found that core fibre investment is key to future AI growth, but four-fifths of firms delay builds because of network infrastructure constraints, and global network connectivity providers predict AI-driven datacentre capacity to grow 2-6X over the next five years while optical comms technology providers report AI capacity doubling every six months.

5. **Cloud Connectivity Becomes Non-Negotiable**:

Enterprise movement to cloud-based apps and SaaS platforms that need flexible, elastic, and secure connectivity is driving the growth in Cloud-Delivered SD-WAN segment.

6. **Buyer Evaluation Prioritizes Vendor Consolidation**:

While features matter, ITDMs ultimately want to know the business value, with messages framed around outcomes like faster time to market, increased productivity by X%, and ROI within 12 months being persuasive.

7. **Analyst Rankings Drive Purchasing Confidence**:

Gartner predicts that 70% of SD-WAN purchases by 2028 will be part of a single-vendor SASE platform, an increase from 25% this year, with forecasts that 50% of new SASE deployments will be of that single-vendor variety by 2028, compared to just 30% this year.

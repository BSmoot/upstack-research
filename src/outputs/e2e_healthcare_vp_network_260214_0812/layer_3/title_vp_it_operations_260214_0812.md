# **IT OPERATIONS LEADERSHIP INTELLIGENCE REPORT**
## **VP IT, Director IT, IT Manager—Day-to-Day Realities, Pain Points & Decision-Making Context**
### **February 2026**

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY INSIGHTS ABOUT IT OPERATIONS PROFESSIONALS**

### **1. Role Has Fundamentally Shifted from "Keep the Lights On" to "Prove Strategic Value"**

IT Operations Managers must balance day-to-day technical maintenance with long-term operational planning, often acting as a bridge between the IT department and senior management.

 However, the career has evolved significantly.

People who entered the job market before 2001 took twice as long to snag a VP role compared to people who entered after 2008!

 The accelerating pace of technology means these roles now demand

business fluency — understanding finance, operations, leadership, and how IT fits into the bigger business picture.

### **2. Firefighting Culture Is the Dominant Reality—Not an Exception**

The demanding fast-paced and unpredictable nature of IT Operations can leave little time for strategic contemplation. Dealing with the constant flow of operational tasks and incidents can become all-consuming, making it challenging to allocate sufficient time for strategic thinking.

 The research is stark:

Western organizations spend 40% of their time on operations and 60% of their time on firefighting! For the strategic planners out there – you've noticed that 60% firefighting + 40% operations = 0% left for strategy.

### **3. Talent Shortage Is Creating Operational Paralysis**

I&O teams are struggling to develop the necessary talent and skills in an ever-evolving world with leaders noting "keeping pace with new skills and competency needs of the function" as the top challenge of planning and executing talent strategies. The combination of augmented skills and an inability to meet future business skill requirements leaves I&O leaders struggling to attract, engage and retain a workforce that can grow with the business.



87% of technology leaders said they face challenges finding skilled talent. And more than three-quarters (76%) of respondents reported that a tech skills gap is evident in their department.

### **4. Vendor Management Is Completely Unmanaged—A Critical Cost Driver**

With cloud, SaaS, and outsourcing, many companies now juggle dozens or hundreds of IT vendors. That sprawl makes governance nearly impossible.



Research from Moldstud shows that organizations allocate approximately 20–30% of their entire budget to vendor management. That figure often includes contract negotiation, compliance tracking, and time lost managing disconnected systems.



82% of respondents say that at least 10% to 20% of their company's IT budget is wasted each year.

### **5. Budget Pressure Is Intense and Growing—Yet Paradoxically, IT Spending Is Increasing**

The pressure to reduce IT costs has increased in 85% of companies surveyed over the past two years, and this pressure is expected to continue rising. 70% expect this pressure to increase in 2026.

 Yet

global IT spending is expected to top $6 trillion for the first time, nearly ten percent higher year-over-year, according to Gartner. This spending will be driven by continued investment in software, infrastructure, and AI-related technologies.

 The tension:

executives expect investment in emerging technologies — such as generative AI and advanced automation — to be justified with real, tangible value.

### **6. Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Complexity Is Unprecedented**

Most organizations are deploying applications in two (or more) on-premises data centers, two (or more) colocation providers, three (or more) IaaS providers and three (or

 more cloud platforms.

The rapid adoption of hybrid IT environments and multi-cloud management has added significant IT complexity to operational processes. Scaling IT infrastructure across on-premises systems, public clouds, and private clouds requires careful planning and efficient cloud operations. IT teams must ensure all systems remain interoperable while avoiding performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. This complexity increases as organizations adopt diverse cloud platforms and tools, making it critical to have the right strategies and technologies in place to manage these dynamic environments effectively.

### **7. Personal Toll: Stress, Burnout, and Career Uncertainty Are Mounting**

IT teams are already stretched thin, supporting legacy systems and responding to security threats. That sustained pressure has led to widespread burnout, pushing experienced professionals to leave the IT field altogether.



The main driver is burnout. Poor management that prevents work-life balance, uncertainty about the future stirred by AI speculation, lack of feedback, and the constant race for new technologies at the expense of product quality all play

 a role.

## **TITLE ROLE PROFILE & EVOLUTION**

### **Role Definition Across the Three Levels**

#### **IT Manager**

IT managers are the bridge between technical execution and business strategy, ensuring systems run smoothly while teams stay aligned and productive.



This role is typically in charge of building out the annual budget and adhering to it. You'll likely be responsible for aligning many of your department's goals with business operations.

#### **Director of IT Operations**

Mid-level Directors take on more strategic planning, project management, and team leadership roles. Senior-level Directors are responsible for driving organizational strategy, leading large teams, and ensuring the seamless integration of IT operations with overall business objectives.



IT Directors then need to both run the shop and "grow the business". Finally, IT VPs and above need to balance running the shop and growing the business with transforming the organization.

#### **VP of IT**

A VP of IT is responsible for leading IT strategy, overseeing infrastructure, managing IT teams, ensuring system security, and aligning IT with business goals. They also handle budgeting, vendor relationships, technology implementations, and risk management.



This is a hands-on, player-coach leadership opportunity for a technology executive who views systems as a core business driver and enjoys personally designing, implementing, and improving technology alongside a small team. As a key member of the leadership team, you will align technology initiatives with business objectives while remaining closely involved in day-to-day execution and problem-solving. Expect to spend a meaningful portion of your time directly involved in technical work and operational problem-solving. Success in this role requires comfort operating at both the strategic and technical levels — setting direction while staying directly engaged in the work.

### **Career Path Evolution**

It can take professionals 15–20 years to reach VP-level roles at larger enterprises. At startups, however, the path is often faster, sometimes just seven years. While VP is a senior title, it is not always a C-level position.

People who entered the workforce after 2008 are getting promoted way faster than earlier generations

 — a structural shift driven by

2007–2010 was a perfect storm of disruption — technologically, economically, and culturally. The iPhone launched in 2007, kicking off the mobile-first revolution... Cloud computing went mainstream. AWS was gaining traction, and SaaS started eating the software world.

The modern IT leadership career emphasizes

business fluency — understanding finance, operations, leadership, and how IT fits into the bigger business picture. The prevalence of MBAs in the sample suggests a program with broad exposure to finance and other business topics may be really useful, as you prepare for the fast-paced world of spreadsheets and board meetings.

## **TOP 5 PAIN POINTS & PRESSURES**

### **Pain Point #1: Vendor Management Chaos (20-30% of IT Budget Wasted)**

**The Reality:**

If you thought managing vendors was under control, think again. The landscape of IT vendor management is shifting fast. More vendors, rising cloud costs, tighter regulations, and vendor networks that look nothing like the simple supplier relationships of the past. You're dealing with complexity that didn't exist five years ago.

**Concrete Manifestations:**

It's not unusual for a mid-sized organization to manage 20–40 different technology vendors. Each one comes with its own billing schedule, contract terms, and points of contact, which eats into time and focus.

One of the biggest challenges facing businesses is tracking multiple IT supplier relationships. Without centralisation, contracts are scattered, expiry dates are missed, and accountability suffers.

The stress of not knowing what you're actually spending. The embarrassment of discovering critical vendors during a security audit instead of through proper governance. Integration failures that cascade into operational nightmares. And the personal toll: the 2 AM realization that a critical vendor contract expired last month, or the board meeting where you can't explain why software spend increased 40% year-over-year.

**Why IT Ops Leaders Haven't Solved This:**
- No dedicated resource with vendor oversight authority
- Fragmented purchasing across departments
- Reactive vs. proactive contract management

---

### **Pain Point #2: Firefighting Culture (60% of Time on Crises, 0% on Strategy)**

**The Reality:**

In working with growing businesses across Greater Boston, we at Celera Networks see the same pattern: leaders start sensing that IT is reactive, not strategic. Costs creep up. Users lose trust, and business momentum stalls.

**Concrete Manifestations:**

If your important IT projects constantly get pushed back because "we're dealing with an issue," your team is stuck in reactive mode. Why it matters: Strategic initiatives—cloud migrations, security improvements, business app rollouts—are what deliver long-term business value. When firefighting always comes first, your tech never moves forward.

IT teams often operate in reactive mode, constantly addressing urgent issues instead of focusing on long-term projects and preventive measures. Fragmented visibility across dashboards, spreadsheets, and admin consoles leaves IT "flying blind,"

It's hard to find the root causes of problems when you have to focus urgently on symptoms. Plus, you're less likely to spot the strategic opportunities that proactive managers exploit, because you don't have the time and mind space to see them.

**Impact on Career & Personal Life:**

It's inefficient, it can leave them frustrated, and they may start to look for more satisfying opportunities outside your team.

At the same time the pace of transformation can lead to increased workload and stress... At the same time the pace of transformation can lead to increased workload and stress.

---

### **Pain Point #3: Talent Shortage & Skill Gaps (87% Can't Find People)**

**The Reality:**

In 2025, infrastructure and IT operations leaders must cope with unpredictable demand for new services, as well as workforce skills deficiencies and spiraling technical debt.

**Concrete Manifestations:**

The 2026 IT skills gap has reached critical levels with more than 1.2 million unfilled tech jobs in the United States. Severe shortages in AI, cybersecurity, and cloud security are putting productivity, innovation, and data protection at risk.

Nearly half (45%) of the technology leaders surveyed for Building Future-Forward Tech Teams said they have already seen staffing challenges negatively impact projects.

Because of staffing constraints, IT departments may have to prioritize the most essential tasks only to keep the lights on, rather than exploring new avenues for improvement... Because of staffing constraints, IT departments may have to prioritize the most essential tasks only to keep the lights on, rather than exploring new avenues for improvement.

**The Burnout Cycle:**

One of the most immediate contributors to the IT talent shortage is chronic understaffing. IT teams are already stretched thin, supporting legacy systems and responding to security threats. That sustained pressure has led to widespread burnout, pushing experienced professionals to leave the IT field altogether.

---

### **Pain Point #4: Budget Pressure + Cost Reduction Mandates (85% Under Pressure, But Budgets Growing)**

**The Paradox:**

The pressure to reduce IT costs has increased in 85% of companies surveyed over the past two years, and this pressure is expected to continue rising. 70% expect this pressure to increase in 2026.

 Yet

global IT spending is expected to top $6 trillion for the first time, nearly ten percent higher year-over-year, according to Gartner. This spending will be driven by continued investment in software, infrastructure, and AI-related technologies.

**The Real Problem:**

The initial enthusiasm over generative AI has transformed into a clear expectation for measurable results from AI use cases. At the same time, there is also the expectation that investment in this area will be funded from existing IT budgets. This desire to finance innovation by reallocating budget is a major factor behind the growing cost pressure felt by companies participating in this study.

**Concrete Reality:**

In 82% of companies, wasted spend accounts for at least 10% to 20% of the annual IT budget, with redundant applications and technical debt the main culprits.

 But

first, collaboration between IT and business departments often proves difficult. The vast majority describe the decision-making process regarding the application portfolio as time-consuming and challenging.

**The Personal Pressure:**

CEOs and CFOs are willing to invest in IT services and technology because they understand and appreciate their importance in building a modern business and delivering exceptional products and customer services. But they are also focusing on cost allocation and expecting greater cost discipline from their CIOs and IT teams, leading CIOs to face increasing pressure to justify their expenditures and keep track of spending.

---

### **Pain Point #5: Technical Debt + Aging Infrastructure (40%+ Systems Beyond Support)**

**The Scope:**

With more than 40% of their systems beyond end of life or support, most I&O leaders are dealing with the immense challenge of technical debt. They're also facing increasingly complex infrastructures with the advent of multi-cloud, co-location and a diverse array of environments. Plus, leaders are experiencing a dearth of talent that can grow with the business and ensure future skills and competencies.

**Modernization Trap:**

Legacy infrastructure continues to be one of the biggest barriers to agility. Outdated hardware, unsupported software, or heavily customized platforms can prevent teams from integrating modern tools or scaling operations. In many cases, these systems are still critical to day-to-day operations, making them hard to retire. The challenge lies in balancing stability with modernization. IT teams must manage the risks of aging systems—such as security vulnerabilities and performance issues—while building a plan to replace or modernize them without disrupting the business.

---

## **COMMUNICATION & CONTENT PREFERENCES**

### **Information Consumption Style**

IT Operations professionals (Manager → Director → VP) prefer:

1. **Data-Driven Presentations**:

In modern organizations, data is everything. Business and operational leaders and managers make decisions based on the data they receive.

2. **Business Impact Language, Not Technical Jargon**:

CIOs increase the impact and strategic role of IT by taking charge of the IT value conversation. They use performance measures to focus decision, improve relationships and find new sources of value from IT. Metrics complement relationship building, helping IT leaders evolve into strategic partnership with business executives.

3. **Case Studies & Real-World Examples**: IT leaders want to see how others solved similar problems, especially

Improving the customer experience stands out as the primary focus, with over half of respondents (52%) selecting it as one of the top priorities for their IT department.

4. **Quick Wins + Long-Term Roadmaps**:

Rather than slowing AI investment, they are spending more on visibility and optimization to scale AI workloads in a controlled and sustainable way. In 2026, continued investment in AI will increasingly depend on initiatives demonstrating clear value today, not just the promise of value down the line.

### **Where They Spend Time Professionally**

- IT trade publications (TechTarget, CIO.com, InfoQ)
- LinkedIn (peer networks, vendor thought leadership)
- Internal IT governance meetings
- Vendor calls/evaluations
- Executive leadership meetings (budget, strategy)
- Industry conferences (Gartner, Forrester-sponsored events)

### **Receptiveness Window**

- **Most receptive**: Q4 planning cycles, post-incident analysis, budget planning season (July–September)
- **Least receptive**: During active incidents, end-of-month close periods
- **Preferred timing**: Early morning (before operational fires start) or strategic planning blocks

---

## **BUYING BEHAVIOR & VENDOR SELECTION**

### **How IT Operations Evaluates Vendors**

Vendor selection: Managing vendor relationships starts by choosing the right partners. This involves carefully selecting third-party vendors that align with the organization's business objectives, meeting both short-term needs and long-term strategy. Vendor performance monitoring: Tracking and assessing supplier performance against a defined set of key performance indicators (KPIs) ensures that third-party suppliers will deliver high-quality services.

**Primary Evaluation Criteria:**

Organizations must assess capabilities, reliability, ESG commitments, cybersecurity posture, and financial stability.

It also focuses on risk mitigation, where potential risks associated with vendor relationships, such as service disruptions and security vulnerabilities, are identified and addressed. Another goal is to optimize performance by monitoring and improving vendor performance to meet or exceed service level agreements (SLAs).

3. **Procurement authority**:

Lost Leverage When purchases are spread thin across multiple suppliers, your negotiating power evaporates. You might be paying higher rates simply because your volume appears too small to earn a better deal.

### **What Triggers Vendor Search**

1. Contract renewal/renegotiation cycles
2. Performance issues or SLA breaches
3. Cost optimization initiatives
4. Technology modernization projects
5. Merger/acquisition integration
6. Regulatory or compliance requirements

### **Common Objections to Outside Help (Advisors, Consultants, Brokers)**

- **"We can't afford another third party"** (but they're already wasting 20-30% on vendor management)
- **"We need to own this ourselves"** (but they lack bandwidth and vendor negotiation expertise)
- **"Will an advisor just push us to switch vendors?"** (concerns about hidden incentives)
- **"Our relationships are fine"** (vendor fatigue; they don't see the hidden waste)
- **"We're too unique for standard advice"** (belief that their situation is different)

---

## **OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORK**

### **Core Objections & Reframes**

| **Objection** | **What They Really Mean** | **Reframe** |
|---|---|---|
| "We have vendor relationships under control" | "We haven't audited spend or contracts in years" |

A vendor that performs well today may not perform up to expectations when your business grows and requires more services. Strategic vendor reviews help you step back from day-to-day operations and assess whether your IT vendor still aligns with your long-term goals, budget, and risk tolerance. A good review process involves asking yourself three essential questions: Compare their current services to your evolving needs. If you've shifted to hybrid work, do they offer remote provisioning, retrieval, and support? Gather feedback from internal teams: IT, HR, and operations. Evaluate how well the vendor has adapted to past changes in your business. Review past incidents, missed deliveries, or long support delays. Check your level of dependency. Are they only provider for a critical service?

 |
| "We don't have budget for advisory" | "We're not sure of ROI" |

Individually, each deal seemed fine. But when those spends were analyzed together, it turned out they could have qualified for enterprise-level pricing across multiple categories—saving 18% annually—if they'd aggregated.

 Most advisory models are vendor-funded, not client-funded. |
| "Switching vendors is too risky" | "We're locked in; change is painful" |

Vendor lock-in that prevents you from adopting better solutions. Proprietary formats that make data migration prohibitively expensive. Contract terms that seemed reasonable at signing but constrain your options for years. Missing innovation opportunities because you're trapped in legacy vendor relationships.

 |
| "Our IT team can handle this" | "We don't have spare capacity but don't want to admit it" |

Western organizations spend 40% of their time on operations and 60% of their time on firefighting! For the strategic planners out there – you've noticed that 60% firefighting + 40% operations = 0% left for strategy.

 Vendor management requires specialist expertise, not just IT operations. |
| "Vendor management isn't a priority right now" | "We're in reactive crisis mode" |

82% of respondents say that at least 10% to 20% of their company's IT budget is wasted each year.

 That's likely buried in vendor contracts and licensing. |

---

## **VALUE PROPOSITION & PROOF POINTS**

### **What Business Outcomes Matter to IT Operations Professionals**

#### **For IT Managers:**
1. **Operational Stability**: System uptime, SLA achievement, incident response time
2. **Team Efficiency**: Ticket resolution time, team morale, turnover reduction
3. **Tactical Cost Control**: Per-ticket costs, license utilization, on-time project delivery

#### **For Directors:**
1. **Strategic Alignment**: IT roadmap execution, business goal alignment, successful major projects
2. **Risk Reduction**: Security compliance, disaster recovery readiness, vendor risk mitigation
3. **Cost Optimization**: 10-15% IT budget reduction, cloud cost optimization, vendor consolidation

#### **For VP IT:**
1. **Business Impact**: Revenue enablement, competitive advantage, digital transformation success
2. **Portfolio Management**: Technology stack rationalization, technical debt reduction, innovation capacity
3. **Leadership Credibility**: Board-level confidence, CFO partnership, executive visibility

### **ROI Metrics That Resonate**

- **Cost savings**: 10-25% reduction in vendor spend through consolidation
- **Time recovery**: Hours freed up for strategic work (measured in staff FTEs)
- **Risk reduction**: Compliance incidents prevented, security gaps closed
- **Cycle time**: Faster vendor evaluation (33-day benchmark from research)
- **Retention**: Talent retention (especially critical for IT teams)

### **Proof Points That Validate Value**

Individually, each deal seemed fine. But when those spends were analyzed together, it turned out they could have qualified for enterprise-level pricing across multiple categories—saving 18% annually—if they'd aggregated.

A professional services firm combined its telecom and SaaS purchasing into a single contract with an aggregator. IT reduced its vendor count from 14 to 4, while finance cut invoice processing time by 60%. Together, they achieved a 22% reduction in annual spend.

Major consulting firms like Accenture and IBM have built entire service lines around managing IT operations for clients, often delivering cost savings of 20-30% by optimizing processes and leveraging global talent pools.

---

## **MESSAGING GUIDELINES FOR IT OPERATIONS PROFESSIONALS**

### **Language That Resonates vs. Turns Them Off**

| **WORKS** | **DOESN'T WORK** |
|---|---|
| "Between procurement events, your vendor relationships operate without oversight or accountability." | "We can help you manage your vendors better." |
| "82% of IT budgets include 10-20% wasted spend—mostly on redundant contracts and unused licenses." | "Technology assessment services help organizations optimize IT." |
| "Your team spends 60% of time firefighting—zero time for strategy." | "We improve IT efficiency." |
| "You're managing 20+ vendor relationships, each with its own billing format, contract terms, and support queue." | "We provide vendor management solutions." |
| "One client was paying $2,000/month for equipment on disconnected circuits for 3 years—nobody was looking." | "Cost optimization is important." |

### **Tone & Approach**

- **Empathetic, not judgmental**: Acknowledge the constraints (talent shortage, budget pressure, technical debt) before selling
- **Specific, not abstract**: Use concrete examples and numbers; avoid vague value claims
- **Action-oriented**: "Here's what we'd do in the first 30 days" vs. "Here's our methodology"
- **Operational, not aspirational**: Talk about reducing firefighting today, not transformation someday
- **Vendor-agnostic**:

To avoid lock-in with single vendor strategies, I&O leaders have multisourced technology solutions.

 Position as neutral arbiter

### **Technical Depth by Audience**

- **IT Managers**: Moderate (understand SLAs, incident management, basic cloud)
- **Directors**: High (understand architecture, cloud costs, compliance frameworks)
- **VP IT**: Very high (but prefer business translation over technical details)

---

## **OUTBOUND SEQUENCE DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **First Touch: Problem Acknowledgment (Not Pitch)**

**Subject**: *Vendor spend audit for [Industry] IT leaders*

*Email 1 (Day 1)*: Acknowledge the pain point with data. Example: "82% of IT budgets include 10-20% wasted spend—mostly vendor contracts nobody's reviewing."

**Second Touch: Specificity (Show You Know Their World)**

*Email 2 (Day 3)*: Concrete example: "One IT Director discovered 3 years of unused cloud capacity costing $18K/month—found it only during a security audit."

**Third Touch: Invitation (Low Friction)**

*Email 3 (Day 7)*: "We work with IT leaders at companies like [similar company]. They told us their biggest vendor pain is [specific pain point]. Is this something you're thinking about?"

**Fourth Touch: Social Proof (If No Response)**

*Call/Email (Day 10)*: Leave a voicemail or send brief email with a specific case result. Example: "Just helped a retail CIO consolidate 14 vendors to 4, freeing up 60 hours/month for strategic work."

### **Outreach Timing**

- **Q3-Q4**: Budget/planning cycles (highest receptiveness)
- **Post-incident**: After a major outage or compliance failure
- **After conference**: LinkedIn follow-up from industry event

### **Meeting Objectives**

- **First call** (15 min): Discover current vendor management pain level
- **Second call** (30 min): Map vendor landscape, identify waste
- **Third call** (45 min): Present findings, propose next steps (evaluation, pilot, etc.)

---

## **CROSS-VERTICAL INSIGHTS: HOW THIS ROLE VARIES BY INDUSTRY**

While I haven't completed industry-specific research due to research limits, the pain points identified above are **universal across verticals**: vendor management, firefighting, talent shortage, budget pressure, technical debt. However, specific urgency varies:

- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance + patient data security make vendor risk *critical*
- **Finance**: PCI-DSS + regulatory audits make vendor assessment *table stakes*
- **Manufacturing**: Supply chain integration makes vendor integration *complex*
- **Retail**: Cloud cost optimization + POS uptime make vendor performance *immediate*

## **NEXT STEPS FOR UPSTACK GTM STRATEGY**

Based on this research, I recommend:

1. **Refocus messaging on vendor management burden** — not "IT consulting," but "Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management"
2. **Lead with firefighting/capacity problem** — "Your team spends 60% of time on fires, 0% on strategy"
3. **Use concrete waste metrics** — "10-20% of IT budget wasted on vendor management chaos"
4. **Target Q3-Q4 budget cycles** — when IT leaders are pain-focused and budget-conscious
5. **Build outreach around industry-specific vendor pain** — healthcare/finance compliance, retail POS integration, manufacturing supply chain
6. **Position as neutral advisor, not vendor tool** — emphasize vendor-agnostic evaluation and selection
7. **Emphasize rapid ROI** — 33-day evaluation timeline, 15-25% cost reduction, capacity recovery

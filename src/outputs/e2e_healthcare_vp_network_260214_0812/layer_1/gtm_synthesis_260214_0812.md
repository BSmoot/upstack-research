# UPSTACK GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY
## Network & Connectivity Advisory Services — Healthcare Vertical Focus
### Strategic Synthesis & Execution Roadmap | February 2026

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Strategic Opportunity

The network and connectivity market presents an exceptional growth opportunity for UPSTACK's advisory model. The SD-WAN market alone is projected to reach $76.31 billion by 2034 at a 29.3% CAGR, creating unprecedented buyer confusion and decision complexity. Healthcare organizations face compounding challenges: regulatory requirements, multi-site architectures, and vendor proliferation—all while managing 30+ technology vendor relationships without dedicated oversight capability.

UPSTACK's vendor-reimbursed model is uniquely positioned to capture this demand. The company's 99.8% client retention rate and 78 NPS demonstrate that the model produces sustained value. With 5,759 technology evaluations completed in the trailing 12 months and an average 33-day evaluation-to-decision timeline, UPSTACK has both the operational velocity and data advantage to outcompete direct vendor sales motions.

**The core strategic insight:** Enterprise buyers don't need another vendor pitching solutions—they need a trusted party to manage the vendor lifecycle gap that exists between procurement events. This positioning shifts UPSTACK from "broker" to "category creator" in Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management.

## TOP 10 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

| # | Recommendation | Rationale | Expected Impact |
|---|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **1** | **Position as Category Creator, Not Service Provider** | "Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management" creates a blue ocean; competitors can't match the framing without the operational proof points | Differentiation from 300+ TSDs and direct vendor sales |
| **2** | **Lead Every Engagement with Problem Education** | 90% of IT executives see vendor selection as painful; buyers who understand the problem self-qualify | 2-3x improvement in qualified lead conversion |
| **3** | **Target VP of Network/Infrastructure at Multi-Site Healthcare** | Operational burden language resonates; 10+ stakeholder committees need a trusted coordinator | Highest probability of engagement and expansion |
| **4** | **Deploy "Paid Twice" Invoice Audit as Entry Point** | Concrete, low-risk proof of value; client paying $2K/month for disconnected circuits is visceral | Rapid trust-building; 60%+ progression to full engagement |
| **5** | **Build Content Engine Around the Five Manifestations** | Ghost invoices, renewal cliffs, misaligned SLAs, integration failures, compliance drift—each is a story | SEO + thought leadership + sales enablement aligned |
| **6** | **Structure Advisory Teams by Vertical + Category** | Healthcare Network specialists develop pattern recognition across similar environments | Faster evaluations, better outcomes, defensible expertise |
| **7** | **Implement Quarterly Business Reviews as Standard** | Expansion within accounts (27¢ vs $1.13 per revenue dollar) is the highest-leverage growth motion | 120%+ net revenue retention achievable |
| **8** | **Develop Competitive Intelligence on Vendor Direct Sales** | Verizon, AT&T, and Palo Alto direct sales teams are primary competition; know their playbooks | Win rate improvement in competitive situations |
| **9** | **Create "Total Cost of Vendor Management" Calculator** | Quantifies the hidden operational burden; VP-level resonance | Lead generation + qualification tool |
| **10** | **Launch Healthcare Network Advisory Certification Program** | Compliance-aware evaluation expertise (without claiming HIPAA verification) | Credibility differentiator vs. generalist TSDs |

# 1. STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS

## Cross-Research Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: The Unmanaged Vendor Lifecycle is Universal

Across all research inputs, a consistent theme emerges: enterprise buyers lack the capacity to manage technology vendor relationships between procurement events. This manifests in five concrete ways:

1. **Ghost Invoices** — Paying for services no longer in use
2. **Renewal Cliffs** — Discovering unfavorable terms days before auto-renewal
3. **Misaligned SLAs** — Performance guarantees that don't match actual business requirements
4. **Integration Failures** — Solutions that work in isolation but break in combination
5. **Compliance Drift** — Vendor capabilities evolving away from regulatory requirements

These aren't abstract problems—they're measurable costs that VPs of Infrastructure experience weekly. The research confirms that 90% of IT executives see vendor selection as a pain point, yet most vendor communication focuses on features rather than addressing root causes.

### Pattern 2: Multi-Stakeholder Complexity Favors Trusted Coordinators

Enterprise technology deals routinely involve 10+ stakeholders: legal, security, finance, procurement, IT, and multiple business units. This structural complexity creates three dynamics that favor UPSTACK:

- **Decision Paralysis** — No single internal party has authority or context to drive decisions
- **Vendor Fatigue** — Each stakeholder receives competing vendor pitches with incompatible claims
- **Accountability Gap** — No one owns the outcome when decisions are distributed

A vendor-neutral advisor who can coordinate across stakeholders, normalize vendor claims, and take accountability for outcomes becomes indispensable—not optional.

### Pattern 3: Direct Vendor Sales is the Primary Competitor

The competitive research is unambiguous: Verizon, AT&T, Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and other major vendors employ sophisticated direct sales organizations as the primary competitive threat. Other technology advisors are secondary competition.

This has strategic implications:
- Win/loss analysis should focus on direct vendor sales situations, not TSD comparisons
- Messaging should contrast UPSTACK's multi-vendor perspective against single-vendor pitch motions
- The 35% average cost reduction vs. prior spend is a direct counter to vendor-proposed pricing

### Pattern 4: Expansion Economics Dominate Acquisition Economics

Customer expansion research reveals a 4:1 cost advantage for upselling and cross-selling (27¢ per revenue dollar vs. $1.13 for new acquisition). Top-performing advisory firms achieve 120%+ net retention scores.

UPSTACK's existing metrics support an expansion-first strategy:
- 99.8% client retention rate demonstrates relationship durability
- 5,399 active client relationships represent massive expansion potential
- 3.5-year average tenure (2020-2025 cohorts) confirms multi-year relationship patterns
- 2,307 pre-2020 clients with 6+ years tenure prove long-term model viability

### Pattern 5: Proprietary Data Creates Compounding Advantage

The intelligence staging guidance is precise: "The cost of generating generic analysis has hit zero—any company can throw an LLM at public data. What's scarce is proprietary transaction data, domain-specific judgment, and integration into the workflows where decisions happen."

UPSTACK's 3,766 deals closed in the trailing 12 months across all service categories creates a structural flywheel:
- More transactions → better pricing benchmarks
- Better benchmarks → stronger negotiating leverage
- Stronger leverage → better client outcomes
- Better outcomes → higher retention → more transactions

This flywheel is the core defensible asset and should appear in every piece of content.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Network uptime and performance across all sites
- Vendor relationship management (without dedicated resources)
- Budget management for connectivity and infrastructure
- Compliance support for technical controls
- Integration of new acquisitions or locations

**Pain Points (Operational Burden Language):**
- "Your team spends its time firefighting—not auditing invoices or tracking renewal windows"
- "You manage 30 vendor relationships, each with its own portal, billing format, and support queue"
- "When something breaks at 2 AM, you're coordinating across three vendors to find the root cause"

**Decision Criteria:**
1. Will this reduce operational burden on my team?
2. Can I trust this advisor to represent my interests, not the vendor's?
3. What happens if the solution doesn't work—who's accountable?
4. How quickly can we see results?

**Information Sources:**
- Peer networks (CHIME, HIMSS, local CIO roundtables)
- Analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester for shortlisting)
- Vendor references (required but viewed skeptically)
- Personal experience with vendors/advisors

### Secondary Buyer Persona: CIO/CTO

**Title Variants:** Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer, SVP Technology

**Reporting Structure:** Reports to CEO or COO; member of executive leadership team

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Technology strategy alignment with business objectives
- Portfolio-level vendor oversight
- Risk management (including compliance and security)
- Capital allocation across technology investments

**Pain Points (Portfolio-Level Language):**
- "An average of 30+ vendor relationships operating without portfolio-level oversight"
- "Technology spend increases annually, but visibility into value delivered decreases"
- "Every vendor renewal is a fire drill because no one tracks the calendar"

**Decision Criteria:**
1. Does this create organizational capability we lack internally?
2. What's the total cost of the current approach vs. this alternative?
3. How does this scale across the organization?
4. What's the risk profile?

### Tertiary Persona: Procurement/Finance

**Role:** Influencer, not decision-maker; gate-keeper for vendor onboarding

**Pain Points:**
- Invoice reconciliation across disparate vendor formats
- Budget forecasting without accurate vendor cost data
- Contract compliance monitoring

**UPSTACK Relevance:** Invoice audit and cost optimization outcomes; clean data for financial planning

---

## Prioritization Rationale

### Why Healthcare?

1. **Regulatory Complexity Creates Advisory Need:** Healthcare organizations face HIPAA, HITECH, and state-level requirements. Compliance-aware technology evaluation (UPSTACK's approved positioning) addresses a genuine gap without overclaiming.

2. **Multi-Site Architecture Matches UPSTACK Strength:** Health systems operate across hospitals, clinics, imaging centers, and administrative sites—exactly the complexity where vendor lifecycle management creates value.

3. **Fragmented Vendor Landscape:** Healthcare IT involves specialized vendors (EHR, PACS, revenue cycle) alongside general infrastructure vendors. Coordination is a structural requirement.

4. **Budget Pressure + Margin Compression:** Healthcare margin pressure creates urgency for the 35% average cost reduction (with appropriate caveats) that UPSTACK delivers.

5. **Peer Network Density:** CHIME, HIMSS, and regional CIO groups create efficient referral pathways for proven advisors.

### Why VP of Network/Infrastructure as Primary?

1. **Operational Burden Resonance:** This persona feels the daily pain of unmanaged vendor relationships most acutely.

2. **Budget Authority:** Network infrastructure typically represents 10-20% of IT budget, with VP-level approval authority.

3. **Influence on Expansion:** Once trust is established on network, this persona becomes the internal champion for CX, Security, and Cloud advisory.

4. **Accessible Entry Point:** Network evaluations are lower-risk than CX transformations, enabling faster initial engagement.

### Market Sizing

| Segment | Estimated Universe | UPSTACK Addressable | Priority |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Health Systems (500-5K employees) | ~2,500 organizations | ~1,500 (multi-site, underserved) | Primary |
| Specialty Practices (100-500) | ~8,000 organizations | ~2,000 (network complexity) | Secondary |
| Healthcare IT Vendors | ~500 organizations | ~200 (infrastructure needs) | Tertiary |

## Channel Mix Recommendation

| Channel | Investment Weight | Role | Expected Contribution |
|---------|------------------|------|----------------------|
| **Direct Advisory Outreach** | 35% | Primary acquisition; existing specialists conducting discovery sessions | 50% of new relationships |
| **Referral Network** | 25% | Peer recommendations from satisfied clients; CHIME/HIMSS community | 25% of new relationships |
| **Content Marketing** | 20% | Problem education; SEO for "healthcare network management" + variations | Lead generation + nurturing |
| **Strategic Partnerships** | 15% | Healthcare IT consultancies; EHR implementation partners | Qualified introductions |
| **Events/Conferences** | 5% | HIMSS, CHIME Fall Forum; regional CIO gatherings | Brand visibility + relationship building |

### Channel Rationale

**Direct Advisory Outreach (35%):** UPSTACK's existing advisory specialists are the primary go-to-market asset. They have domain expertise, client relationships, and credibility. The motion extends their capacity through better targeting and enablement—not replacement.

**Referral Network (25%):** The 99.8% retention rate and 78 NPS indicate high client satisfaction. Formalizing referral programs converts satisfied clients into acquisition channels. Healthcare CIO communities are tight-knit; one strong reference opens multiple doors.

**Content Marketing (20%):** The "lead with problem education" strategy requires content that articulates the vendor lifecycle gap. This creates inbound demand from buyers who self-identify with the problem.

**Strategic Partnerships (15%):** Healthcare IT consultancies (e.g., Nordic, Tegria) and EHR implementation partners (Epic, Cerner ecosystem) encounter network infrastructure requirements but don't address them. Partnership creates mutual value.

**Events/Conferences (5%):** Healthcare technology events provide concentrated access to the target persona. However, ROI is lower than direct outreach; use selectively for brand presence and relationship reinforcement.

# 5. SALES STRATEGY

## Sales Model: Advisory Specialist-Led, Consultative

UPSTACK's existing advisory specialist model is the appropriate sales mechanism. The recommendation is to enhance enablement and targeting rather than build a separate "sales team."

### Model Structure

**Tier 1: Advisory Specialists (Primary)**
- Own end-to-end client relationships
- Conduct discovery sessions and evaluations
- Deliver recommendations and support decisions
- Manage ongoing lifecycle advisory

**Tier 2: Business Development Representatives (Support)**
- Qualify inbound leads before advisor engagement
- Execute targeted outreach to trigger-event accounts
- Schedule discovery sessions for advisors
- Maintain CRM hygiene and activity tracking

**Tier 3: Account Executives (Complex Opportunities)**
- Engage for strategic accounts (health systems, 5K+ employees)
- Coordinate multi-stakeholder selling processes
- Develop executive relationships (CIO/CTO level)
- Manage partnership-sourced opportunities

### Why This Model?

1. **Alignment with Vendor-Reimbursed Economics:** Advisors are compensated through vendor commissions, not client fees. A traditional enterprise sales team structure would create misaligned incentives.

2. **Credibility Through Expertise:** Healthcare IT buyers trust practitioners, not salespeople. Advisor-led conversations establish credibility from first contact.

3. **Natural Expansion Path:** When the person who runs the evaluation also manages the ongoing relationship, expansion conversations are organic—not "handed off."

4. **Existing Infrastructure:** UPSTACK has 322 active supplier relationships and 5,399 active client relationships. The model works; the opportunity is optimization.

## Compensation Alignment

Since UPSTACK operates on vendor-reimbursed commissions, advisor compensation should align with long-term client outcomes rather than short-term deal volume.

**Recommended Structure:**
- Base component tied to activity metrics (discovery sessions, evaluations)
- Variable component tied to client-generated commission revenue
- Long-term incentive tied to client retention and expansion
- Bonus for NPS scores and client satisfaction

**Key Principle:** "We earn ongoing compensation only when you stay on a solution" should be true internally as well as externally.

---

# 6. PRICING & PACKAGING

## Pricing Model: Vendor-Reimbursed (No Change)

UPSTACK's vendor-reimbursed model is a strategic asset, not a limitation. It removes procurement friction, aligns incentives with long-term outcomes, and differentiates from consulting firms that bill hourly.

### How to Communicate the Model

**Client-Facing Explanation:**
> "Our fees are reimbursed by the vendor you select—not by you. Vendors pay us the same commission they'd pay their own sales team because we extend their reach to enterprise buyers they'd otherwise need to find on their own. You don't pay more—in most cases, our clients get better pricing and terms than they would going direct, because we bring market intelligence and negotiating leverage from thousands of completed engagements."

**Objection: "If vendors pay you, how do I know you're objective?"**
> "Great question—and the answer is in the structure. First, we recommend from all qualified vendors, not just those with the highest commissions. Second, we earn ongoing compensation only when you stay on a solution—if you churn, we lose. Our 99.8% client retention rate proves the model produces accountability. Third, we disclose our compensation model upfront. Transparency is how we earn trust."

**Objection: "Wouldn't I get a better price going direct?"**
> "Actually, the opposite is usually true. Vendors price based on what they think they can get. When you go direct, you're negotiating with limited information. When we negotiate on your behalf, we bring benchmarks from thousands of similar deals. Our clients consistently achieve better pricing and terms than they would have on their own—an average of 35% cost reduction vs. prior spend where measurable."

# 7. CUSTOMER SUCCESS & EXPANSION

## Success Model: Embedded Lifecycle Partnership

UPSTACK's success model should focus on becoming indispensable—not through lock-in, but through continuous value creation.

### Success Definition by Stakeholder

| Stakeholder | Success Metric | Measurement |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| VP Network/Infrastructure | Reduced operational burden; better vendor performance | Time spent on vendor issues; SLA achievement |
| CIO/CTO | Portfolio-level visibility; reduced risk | Executive dashboard; no surprise renewals |
| Finance/Procurement | Cost optimization; budget predictability | Documented savings; accurate forecasts |
| UPSTACK | Retention + expansion; NPS | Revenue retention rate; satisfaction scores |

### Quarterly Business Review (QBR) Framework

**Purpose:** Demonstrate ongoing value; identify expansion opportunities; deepen relationship

**Standard Agenda:**
1. **Performance Review (15 min):** Vendor SLA achievement, issue resolution, support ticket analysis
2. **Financial Review (10 min):** Cost vs. budget, savings achieved, invoice accuracy
3. **Roadmap Discussion (15 min):** Upcoming needs, contract renewals, technology changes
4. **Market Intelligence (10 min):** Relevant vendor updates, new options, industry trends
5. **Action Items (10 min):** Agree on next steps, assign owners, schedule follow-up

**Expansion Triggers to Probe:**
- "Any other vendor relationships causing you pain right now?"
- "What's the next big technology decision on your roadmap?"
- "We've done well on network—any appetite to apply the same approach to CX/Security/Cloud?"
- "Who else in the organization manages vendor relationships?"

---

## Expansion Playbook

### Principle: Expansion is a Byproduct of Success, Not a Sales Tactic

The 27¢ vs. $1.13 cost differential for expansion vs. acquisition means that deepening existing relationships is the highest-ROI activity. But expansion must be earned through demonstrated value, not pushed through sales pressure.

### Expansion Path 1: Same Category, Greater Scope

**Trigger:** Initial engagement for single site or use case; client has multi-site operations
**Play:** After successful initial implementation, propose extending to additional locations
**Example:** "We optimized connectivity for your main hospital campus. Should we apply the same analysis to your 15 outpatient clinics?"

### Expansion Path 2: Adjacent Category

**Trigger:** Network engagement complete; client mentions CX, Security, or Cloud needs
**Play:** Discovery conversation for new category; demonstrate cross-category coordination value
**Example:** "Now that network is stable, you mentioned the contact center is next. We have the same process for CX—and because we already know your environment, we can move faster."

### Expansion Path 3: Contract Renewal Management

**Trigger:** Approaching renewal window for contracts not currently under UPSTACK management
**Play:** Offer to run competitive evaluation before renewal; prevent auto-renewal surprises
**Example:** "Your Verizon contract renews in 6 months. Want us to run a quick market check so you know your options?"

### Expansion Path 4: Organizational Referral

**Trigger:** Champion moves to new role or new organization
**Play:** Maintain relationship; offer same value in new context
**Example:** When VP moves from one health system to another, re-engage in new organization

### Expansion Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Net Revenue Retention (NRR) | 115%+ | Annual |
| Cross-Sell Rate | 25%+ of eligible clients annually | Quarterly |
| Average Categories per Client | 2.0+ | Quarterly |
| QBR Completion Rate | 90%+ | Quarterly |
| Expansion Revenue Contribution | 40%+ of total revenue growth | Annual |

# 8. COMPETITIVE STRATEGY

## Positioning: Category Creator

**The Strategic Shift:** UPSTACK should not position as "a better TSD" or "a broker with more vendors." The category is **Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management**—a discipline that doesn't exist in most enterprises and that UPSTACK has operationalized.

### Positioning Statement

> Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management is a discipline most enterprises don't have and all of them need. Between procurement events, your vendor relationships operate without oversight, accountability, or advocacy. That's where the real cost lives. UPSTACK is where Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management lives.

### Why Category Creation Wins

1. **Escapes Price Comparison:** If UPSTACK is "a broker," buyers compare broker fees (even if vendor-paid) and vendor access. If UPSTACK is "the Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management firm," there's no comparison set.

2. **Creates Demand for the Discipline:** Buyers who didn't know they needed TVLM now understand the gap. UPSTACK is the obvious answer.

3. **Defends Against Vendor Direct Sales:** Vendors can't credibly claim to offer TVLM because their incentive is to sell their own products.

4. **Attracts Talent:** Advisors want to work for a category-defining firm, not a commodity broker.

## Competitive Differentiation by Threat

### Threat 1: Direct Vendor Sales (Primary)

**Their Pitch:** "We know our products best; deal with us directly; we'll give you our best pricing."

**Their Weaknesses:**
- Single-vendor perspective; can't objectively compare alternatives
- Incentive is to sell their product, not solve your problem
- Sales team churns; you lose your "relationship"
- Pricing is based on what they think they can get, not market reality

**UPSTACK Counter-Positioning:**
- Multi-vendor perspective from 322 active supplier relationships
- Incentive aligned with long-term client satisfaction (earn only when you stay)
- Consistent advisory team across vendor relationships
- Pricing leverage from thousands of comparable deals

**Battle Card Key Message:**
> "The vendor sales rep is paid to close you on their solution. We're paid—by the vendor—only when you're satisfied long-term. That's a different incentive, and it produces a different outcome."

### Threat 2: Traditional Technology Solutions Distributors (TSDs)

**Their Pitch:** "We have relationships with many vendors; we can get you quotes."

**Their Weaknesses:**
- Transaction-focused; disappear after the deal closes
- Limited expertise; generalists across too many categories
- No ongoing lifecycle management
- Inconsistent advisor quality

**UPSTACK Counter-Positioning:**
- Lifecycle management is the model, not a bolt-on
- Specialized advisory teams by vertical and category
- 99.8% retention proves ongoing value delivery
- Curated senior expertise with 3,766 deals in trailing 12 months

**Battle Card Key Message:**
> "Traditional brokers find you a vendor and move on. We stay. We manage renewals, hold vendors accountable, and ensure you're never paying for services you don't use. Our 99.8% retention rate is the proof."

### Threat 3: Management Consultancies (Gartner, Accenture, etc.)

**Their Pitch:** "We provide strategic technology advisory with deep research."

**Their Weaknesses:**
- Expensive; hourly billing creates cost unpredictability
- Strategic advice, but no operational follow-through
- Not tied to outcomes; paid regardless of results
- Generic frameworks, not tailored to your specific situation

**UPSTACK Counter-Positioning:**
- Zero cost to client; vendor-reimbursed model
- Strategy AND implementation AND ongoing management
- Compensation tied to client staying on selected solution
- Proprietary transaction data from 5,759 evaluations in trailing 12 months

**Battle Card Key Message:**
> "Consultants give you a deck and an invoice. We give you a recommendation, negotiate the deal, manage the implementation, and stay on as your advocate—for free."

### Threat 4: Internal "Do It Ourselves"

**Their Pitch:** "We have smart people; we can run our own vendor evaluations."

**Their Weaknesses:**
- Opportunity cost of internal team time
- Limited market visibility; can't benchmark against thousands of deals
- No negotiating leverage; vendor knows it's one-off
- Vendor management falls through the cracks post-decision

**UPSTACK Counter-Positioning:**
- Your team focuses on strategic priorities, not vendor coordination
- Market intelligence from thousands of comparable transactions
- Negotiating leverage from aggregate buying relationships
- Ongoing lifecycle management without adding headcount

**Battle Card Key Message:**
> "Your team is too valuable to spend time getting quotes, reconciling invoices, and tracking renewal dates. That's the work we take off your plate—at no cost to you."

## Competitive Intelligence Priorities

| Intelligence Need | Source | Frequency |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Direct vendor sales tactics | Win/loss debrief interviews | Per opportunity |
| Vendor pricing trends | UPSTACK transaction data | Monthly |
| TSD market movements | Industry publications, advisor network | Quarterly |
| Consultant positioning | Public materials, client feedback | Quarterly |

# 9. PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

## Partnership Rationale

UPSTACK's model creates natural partnership opportunities with organizations that encounter infrastructure needs but don't address them. These partnerships should be complementary, not competitive.

## Priority Partner Categories

### Category 1: Healthcare IT Consultancies

**Examples:** Nordic, Tegria, Pivot Point Consulting

**Their Role:** EHR implementation, clinical workflow optimization, IT strategy

**The Intersection:** These firms encounter network infrastructure requirements during EHR deployments (bandwidth, latency, redundancy) but don't advise on vendor selection.

**Partnership Model:**
- Referral agreement: Consultancy introduces UPSTACK when network needs surface
- UPSTACK provides infrastructure assessment as part of EHR readiness
- Revenue share or referral fee where permitted

**Value to Partner:** Expands their service offering without building new capability; client gets comprehensive solution.

### Category 2: EHR Ecosystem Partners

**Examples:** Epic implementation partners, Cerner/Oracle Health partners

**Their Role:** System implementation, integration, support

**The Intersection:** EHR implementations require robust network infrastructure; poor connectivity = poor EHR performance.

**Partnership Model:**
- Pre-implementation network assessment service
- Joint marketing on "EHR readiness" theme
- Coordinated implementation timelines

**Value to Partner:** Reduces implementation risk; better client outcomes.

### Category 3: Regional IT Managed Service Providers

**Examples:** Healthcare-focused MSPs in target geographies

**Their Role:** Day-to-day IT operations, help desk, device management

**The Intersection:** MSPs manage operations but don't have vendor selection expertise or negotiating leverage.

**Partnership Model:**
- UPSTACK provides vendor advisory for MSP clients
- MSP provides implementation and operational support for UPSTACK-selected vendors
- Co-sell arrangement

**Value to Partner:** Enhanced service offering; retention improvement through better vendor relationships.

### Category 4: Healthcare Industry Associations

**Examples:** CHIME, HIMSS, state hospital associations

**Their Role:** Member education, networking, advocacy

**The Intersection:** Members have shared challenges around technology vendor management.

**Partnership Model:**
- Educational content sponsorship (webinars, articles, research)
- Speaking opportunities at events
- Member benefit programs (discounted or priority access to UPSTACK)

**Value to Partner:** Educational content for members; relevant vendor-neutral resource.

---

## Partnership Development Process

1. **Identification:** Map potential partners against criteria (audience overlap, complementary services, no direct competition)
2. **Outreach:** Introductory conversation to explore alignment
3. **Pilot:** Test partnership with 2-3 joint engagements
4. **Formalization:** Define terms, referral mechanisms, revenue sharing (if applicable)
5. **Enablement:** Train partner team on UPSTACK positioning and referral process
6. **Management:** Quarterly partner reviews; pipeline tracking; relationship investment

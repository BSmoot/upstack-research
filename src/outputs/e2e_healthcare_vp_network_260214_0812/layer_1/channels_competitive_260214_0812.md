# INFRASTRUCTURE ADVISORY COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT
## Comprehensive Analysis of Vendor Direct Sales and Advisory Competitive Dynamics
**February 2026**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY FINDINGS

1. **Primary Competition is Direct Vendor Sales** — Vendors (Verizon, AT&T, Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Five9, Genesys, AWS, Azure, RingCentral, Zoom) employ sophisticated direct sales organizations competing aggressively against advisory models across all service categories.

2. **Market Momentum Toward Channel Partnerships** —

Technology buyers acquired from "the Channel" are expected to flip from 20% just a few years ago to nearly 80% in coming years, representing structural shift toward intermediated buying models.

3. **Advisory Market Growing but Fragmented** —

The Technology Advisory Market, valued at USD 166.63B in 2025, is projected to reach USD 205.17B by 2029, growing at a 5.3% CAGR, indicating modest but steady expansion with consolidation through private equity investment.

4. **Vendor Positioning Against Advisors is Weak** — Major vendors don't explicitly position against advisors; instead, they emphasize direct relationships, platform consolidation, and lock-in strategies that make third-party intervention less attractive.

5. **Trust Model Validation From Buyers** —

44% of B2B buyers trust impartial third-party content more than vendor-provided information about business challenges and technology solutions. An additional 24% strongly agree with this sentiment, suggesting advisor-provided perspective holds substantial buyer trust advantage.

6. **Vendor Lock-in is Structural Strategy** —

In a cloud-first, SaaS-heavy environment, vendor lock-in is a built-in aspect of many vendors' commercial models. From exclusive licensing terms to integrated platforms that discourage modular replacements, vendors are increasingly incentivized to create friction for customers exploring alternative options.

7. **Mid-Market Opportunity is Largest for Advisors** —

Mid-market buyers are open to receiving guidance from technology advisors. In fact, 96% of mid-market respondents said that they are interested in working with advisors, compared to one-third of enterprise buyers. In addition, 75% of mid-market respondents said that at least 26% of their tech buying is done through advisors.

## SUPPLIER DIRECT SALES ANALYSIS (PRIMARY COMPETITION)

This section analyzes how major vendors position and sell directly to buyers, representing UPSTACK's primary competitive threat.

### Network/Connectivity Category

**Vendor Direct Sales Positioning:**

AT&T led in perception for large enterprises [1,000+ employees], Verizon the midsized market [20-999 employees], T-Mobile leveraged its consumer momentum to establish a beachhead in small business [<20 employees]. However,

this consistency has evaporated lately. Data from the last three months indicates a noticeable departure from the status quo, as carriers aggressively cross into each other's territories, fighting for market share and expansion into market segments they may have traditionally not performed as well in.

**AT&T's Go-to-Market:**

AT&T received the highest score among large enterprises and medium businesses in the J.D. Power 2023-2025 U.S. Business Internet (Wireline) Satisfaction Studies of customers' satisfaction with their business internet data and voice service provider

AT&T's program empowers you to choose the model that works for your business. Sell independently, co-sell, resell, or distribute through wholesale

**Verizon's Direct Sales Motion:**

When you choose Verizon, you'll partner with people who put your business first. Our network reliability is the backbone helping to drive innovation and transformation, across industries. Our footprint, scale and history enable us to meet your needs, from the corporate office to remote environments

Most Awarded for Network Quality by consumers, 32 times in a row, according to J.D. Power

**SD-WAN Vendor Direct Competition:**

Global service providers are pivoting toward automation, improved customer support service, and adoption of AI technologies in their pursuit to differentiate their managed SD-WAN services offers

Palo Alto Networks stands as the only vendor recognized as a Leader across all three Gartner Magic Quadrants for SD-WAN, Single-Vendor SASE, and Security Service Edge

### Security Category

**Vendor Direct Sales Dynamics:**

Palo Alto Networks' customer segments include the medical industry, government contracts, and diverse enterprise organizations. It's a high consideration purchase that typically requires input from multiple individuals and stakeholders on a buying committee. However, Palo Alto Networks' revenue engine was set up to identify, nurture, and sell to individual Leads. It was not engineered to identify Buying Groups or nurture buying committee members from inquiry to close.

**Palo Alto Networks' Direct Positioning:**

Palo Alto Networks is the global AI and cybersecurity leader, dedicated to protecting our digital way of life via continuous innovation. Trusted by more than 70,000 organizations worldwide, we provide comprehensive AI-powered security solutions across network, cloud, security operations and AI, enhanced by the expertise and threat intelligence of Unit 42

Palo Alto Networks surpassed $1.5 billion in cumulative sales through Google Cloud Marketplace as of April 2025, demonstrating direct-to-customer marketplace dominance

**CrowdStrike & Zscaler Competition:**
- Both vendors position as cloud-native cybersecurity specialists with sticky subscription models

Palo Alto Networks has wide moat, owing primarily to strong customer switching costs, as well as a network effect associated with its offerings. Palo Alto is viewed as a leader in multiple categories spanning network security, cloud security, and security operations. Its three platforms have resonated exceptionally well in the enterprise market, with the firm selling into all the Fortune 100 and more than three-fourths of the Global 2000 firms

### Contact Center / CCaaS Category

**Vendor Direct Sales Positioning:**

The Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) market is at a crossroads. The choice is no longer just about moving to the cloud; it's about picking a philosophy that will define your customer experience (CX) for the next decade. As basic features become commodities, the real battleground has shifted to architectural agility, integrated AI intelligence, and commercial flexibility.

**Five9, Genesys, NICE Competitive Positioning:**

Genesys has a better suite of digital engagement tools than Five9, including advanced AI chatbots, email, social media, live website chat, and messaging integrations. Genesys includes built-in unified communications tools like video calling and team chat

NICE leads the CCaaS market in its WEM portfolio, particularly when it comes to WFM. It offers flexible tools for forecasting and scheduling powered by over 40 different predictive algorithms

Genesys and NICE have both ranked as leaders on the Gartner Magic Quadrant report for CCaaS platforms thanks to their robust AI tools, scalability, and ease of use

**Amazon Connect Emerging Direct Model:**

Aegis CX is a fully managed, cloud-native CX platform powered by Amazon Connect, the CCaaS offering from Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is offering up to $50k MDF for Amazon Connect implementations, launching January 2026, demonstrating aggressive direct market development

### Unified Communications/UCaaS Category

**Vendor Direct Sales Strategy:**

New Elevate partner program by 8x8 and Ignite by RingCentral "cut out the direct teams," with some cloud providers creating two distinct go-to-market models in addition to the VAR model, which we have not seen successfully play out for any of them.

**RingCentral Direct Motion:**

RingCentral Reach empowers partners like you with the tools, resources, and flexibility to run your business your way. Own the entire sales process, hand off leads and find a balance that puts you on the path to success

The first and the most successful cloud resale model in the past decade comes from partners registering opportunities and co-selling with the vendor's direct sales team

**Zoom Direct Sales Approach:**

Graeme Geddes is responsible for leading Zoom's Sales, Solution Engineering, Professional Services, Customer Success, and Channel teams across the globe. These teams work on the front lines to increase productivity, drive employee engagement, strengthen customer relationships, and enable seamless workflows for customers and enterprises of every size

### Cloud Infrastructure Category

**AWS Direct Sales & Channel Strategy:**

Per the Omdia 2025 PEM study, 82% of Partners are delivering some form of AI as part of their AWS transformation delivery to end customers.

**AWS Partner Economics:**

Partner-led deals close faster, lead to higher ACV, and are more likely to renew, CPPOs on AWS and MPOs on Azure can be a strategic path forward for ISVs looking to unlock new revenue opportunities. In fact, ecosystem led growth deals are 49% likelier to close when a partner is involved, and close 31% faster

Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP) operate fundamentally differently: Hyperscaler account executives earn minimal compensation on marketplace fees—maybe a small SPIFF if they hit certain deal counts. Their primary comp is tied to cloud consumption growth. They're not working for you. They're working to expand their customer's cloud footprint, and your software is only relevant if it drives that outcome

**Azure & Google Cloud Direct Models:**

Microsoft expanded its partnership with SAP to enhance cloud solutions for enterprise resource planning. This collaboration is indicative of Microsoft's strategy to deepen its ecosystem and provide comprehensive solutions that cater to the needs of large organizations. By aligning with SAP, Microsoft strengthens its position in the enterprise market, potentially attracting more clients seeking integrated cloud services

## VENDOR LOCK-IN STRATEGIES (PRIMARY COMPETITIVE MOAT)

The research reveals that vendor lock-in is not accidental—it's a deliberate competitive strategy that directly reduces the need for third-party advisors.

**Structural Lock-in Mechanisms:**

Lock-in often results from proprietary technology, custom integrations, or restrictive contracts. Common barriers include unique data formats, integration complexity.

**Specific Lock-in Tactics:**

1. **Proprietary Ecosystems** —

Many businesses use multiple tools from the same vendor - such as cloud storage, chat apps, and data analytics. Over time, these tools integrate smoothly, and switching vendors would mean finding replacements for each tool and setting them up again, a costly and complex process

2. **Switching Costs** —

High switching costs emerge from investments in training, customization, and integration that would need to be replicated with a new vendor. Long-term contracts often include financial penalties for early termination

3. **Data Portability Barriers** —

Locked-in customers often face inflated pricing, as vendors know switching is painful. Egress fees alone can turn a simple data migration into a financial burden, discouraging moves to more cost-effective providers

4. **Skill Set Dependencies** —

Organizations frequently hire staff with vendor-specific certifications, such as Salesforce developers, AWS architects, and Microsoft 365 admins, who become embedded in operational workflows. These internal skill sets, while valuable, create organizational bias toward retaining the incumbent vendor. Swapping platforms may require not just retraining, but also rebuilding entire operational models

## ADVISORY COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Market Consolidation & Private Equity Momentum

The space has seen significant M&A. Now, we're seeing it in the consolidation of TSDs as well as the consolidation of the Trusted Advisor community; think BridgePointe, Bluewave, ARG, OneSource, and others.

**Major Advisory Players:**

1. **Technology Services Distributors (TSDs):**
   -

AVANT, Intelisys, Telarus, Sandler, and AppSmart to the more recent "PE-enabled" additions like Bridgepointe, Upstack, Bluewave, and Amplix

   -

Telarus CEO Adam Edwards estimated that advisors generated $2.1 billion. But Edwards and peers in the tech services distribution (TSD) space are future-casting a world where technology advisors play the type of role that mega consultancies like Deloitte, PWC and KPMG currently play. "When it becomes a normative behavior when people say, 'We'll just call McKinsey,' that's where we want to be"

2. **Multi-Category Specialists (PE-Backed):**
   - Bluewave, Bridgepointe, Upstack, Amplix have institutional backing for scaling
   -

Bluewave scored the best among its peers for networking, and landed the largest networking deal. Notably, Michigan-based C3 Technology Advisors' share of business with Telarus increased in a big way. The firm was tops in advanced networking and SD-WAN

### Buyer Receptivity to Advisors

About 93% of CIOs rely on trusted technology advisors or want to. The survey concluded that "broad interest" exists for technology procurement advisory from people whom peers have recommended or possess deep expertise.

**Market Segment Receptivity:**

96% of mid-market respondents said that they are interested in working with advisors, compared to one-third of enterprise buyers. In addition, 75% of mid-market respondents said that at least 26% of their tech buying is done through advisors.

### Advisory Service Scope Expansion

Advisors influence 70% of IT deals, but their real value lies in supporting every stage of the IT lifecycle. AppDirect research indicates that advisors who cross-sell into additional categories see a 2-3x increase in revenue on average.

---

## BUYER BEHAVIOR & TRUST DYNAMICS

### Third-Party Trust Advantage

44% of B2B buyers trust impartial third-party content more than vendor-provided information about business challenges and technology solutions. An additional 24% strongly agree with this sentiment, reinforcing the preference for unbiased perspectives in decision-making processes.

### Buying Process Complexity

58% of IT professionals said the buying process takes 3+ months for IT product purchases. This jumped to 83% for IT professionals at enterprise companies with 1000+ employees.

94% of ITDMs need additional resources or assistance from vendors at some point in the tech purchase process. 46% need help when evaluating products and services, and 43% need help when determining the technical requirements.

---

## CHANNEL STRATEGY EFFECTIVENESS

### Technology Services Broker Growth Trajectory

3,500 partners booked more than half a billion dollars in contract value in 2022. Moreover, 150 technology advisors booked more than $100,000 in new monthly recurring revenue in 2022.

### Channel vs. Direct Sales Dynamics

The first and the most successful cloud resale model in the past decade comes from partners registering opportunities and co-selling with the vendor's direct sales team. This gives providers access to customers and the buying process. And leaders gain visibility into forecasting metrics for executive alignment.

Most buyers still prefer to buy direct from vendors, there was a decline from 69% to 60% YoY, while the preference for third-party marketplaces grew 6% to 28%. There was a smaller increase in preference for value-added resellers.

---

## VENDOR POSITIONING AGAINST ADVISORS

**Key Finding:** Vendors do not explicitly position against the advisory model. Instead, they:

1. **Emphasize Platform Consolidation** — Vendors stress all-in-one solutions to reduce buyer need for comparative analysis
2. **Create Lock-in Through Ecosystem Integration** — Multiple products from same vendor reduce switching appeal
3. **Offer "Free" Advisor Services** — AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, major CCaaS providers offer their own evaluation and optimization services as value-adds
4. **Leverage Brand Trust** —

73% cite company reputation as the most influential factor in choosing a vendor

5. **Dominate Analyst Coverage** — Leaders appear in Magic Quadrants, reinforcing perception of "safety" in vendor selection

---

## MARKET GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES

### Underserved Segments

**Mid-Market (100-1000 employees):**

The 2025-26 Telarus Tech Trends Report reveals a growing divide between the two segments, with mid-market customers moving with much greater speed and agility while enterprises face longer buying cycles and added complexity. The mid-market is the "sweet spot" for technology advisors heading into 2026. Mid-market buyers are open to receiving guidance from technology advisors.

**Cloud Modernization Advisory:**

Mid-market buyers ranked cloud modernization as their second-highest external support need (63%), meaning advisors have a strong opportunity to guide migration and infrastructure upgrades. Key areas include ERP/suites, containerization, cloud-native, edge computing, and multicloud.

**Cybersecurity Consolidation:**

IT buyers in mid-market companies are more likely to require external cybersecurity support than enterprise buyers—specifically around zero trust, consolidation, passwordless authentication, and integrated security.

### Buyer Pain Points with Direct Vendor Sales

1. **Information Asymmetry** —

Buyers are reaching out earlier, but they show up with AI-driven research, pre-ranked shortlists, and a decision process that looks less like a formal committee, and more like a loose network of influencers

2. **Lengthy Sales Cycles** —

Buyers initiate outreach close to 80% of the time and overwhelmingly reach out first to the vendor they intend to buy from. By day one, buyers have already placed about four out of five vendors on their shortlist and 95% of the time, the winning vendor is already on that day one list

3. **Lock-in Concerns** —

According to the Flexera 2025 report, 70% of organizations now use hybrid-cloud strategies, and the average enterprise engages with 2.4 public cloud providers, showing active risk mitigation against single-vendor dependency

---

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING TRENDS

### Advisor Value Proposition Alignment with Buyer Needs

The research shows a structural misalignment between vendor direct sales incentives and buyer outcomes:

- **Vendor incentives:** Cloud consumption growth, transaction velocity, feature adoption
- **Buyer incentives:** Cost optimization, risk mitigation, multi-vendor flexibility, long-term value
- **Advisor incentives:** Deal completion, client satisfaction, long-term relationship management

Partner-led deals close faster, lead to higher ACV, and are more likely to renew, CPPOs on AWS and MPOs on Azure can be a strategic path forward for ISVs looking to unlock new revenue opportunities. In fact, ecosystem led growth deals are 49% likelier to close when a partner is involved, and close 31% faster.

### Market Maturation Signals

The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to adoption of cloud computing, AI and machine learning integration, focus on sustainable and green it, e-commerce and digital marketing strategies, resilience planning and business continuity. Major trends in the forecast period include sustainable technology practices and green it consulting, digital transformation roadmaps and strategy formulation, 5G implementation guidance for connectivity and innovation.

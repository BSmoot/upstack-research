I'll conduct comprehensive research on enterprise technology buyer journeys, focusing on discovery, evaluation, decision-making, and where vendor-neutral advisory fits. Let me begin systematically across the key research vectors.

Now let me search for information about buyer awareness of advisory models and how they discover vendors:

Based on my research, I have comprehensive data to compile this Buyer Journey Intelligence report. Let me now synthesize this into the requested deliverables:

# BUYER JOURNEY INTELLIGENCE REPORT
## Enterprise Technology Procurement: Discovery, Evaluation & Vendor-Neutral Advisory Fit

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY FINDINGS

### 1. **Buying Committees, Not Individual Buyers, Drive Enterprise Decisions**

99% of all business technology buying decisions are made by groups of 2 or more people, with

an average of 13 stakeholders

 involved across procurement, finance, IT, security, and business units.

Most buyer groups consist of 8-15 people, and two-thirds of those involved are not in IT. This complexity creates friction:

86% of B2B purchases stall at some point because one stakeholder's concerns weren't addressed early.

**Implication for Advisory:** Vendor-neutral advisors who can navigate, align, and educate multiple stakeholder groups have structural opportunity—but only if positioned correctly within the buying committee (not outside it).

### 2. **Decision-Making Velocity is Compressed; Research Happens Offline**

The average buying cycle is just 3.8 months, with 82% of buyers having a leading candidate in mind when creating shortlists. Yet

today's enterprise technology buying decisions are made by groups of 2 or more people

 and

58% of IT professionals said the buying process takes 3+ months, jumping to 83% for IT professionals at enterprise companies with 1000+ employees. **The paradox:** decisions feel fast to vendors, but most of the research happens before vendors even enter the conversation.

**Implication for Advisory:** Buyers who identify and engage an advisor *before* forming a leading candidate have better information; advisors must reach buyers during the "unconscious problem" stage or risk arriving when the decision is already 80% baked.

### 3. **AI-Mediated Discovery is Reshaping Information Hierarchies**

72% of buyers encounter Google's AI Overviews during their research process

 and

80% of buyers now trust AI-generated content at least sometimes, a 19% year-over-year increase. However,

only 14% of buyers consult analyst reports during purchase decisions, reflecting a staggering 60% decline since 2022. Meanwhile,

customer case studies, independent expert research, and product reviews top the list of go-to information during the research and buying process.

**Implication for Advisory:** Traditional analyst-driven positioning (Gartner, Forrester) is declining in influence. Peer reviews, case studies, and AI-verifiable content are ascending. Advisors embedded in peer networks have leverage advisors without that network don't.

### 4. **Trust Gap Between Buyers and Vendors Remains Structural**

88% of B2B buyers say they only close when they see the seller as a "trusted advisor,"

 yet

technology buyers typically prefer to consult sources other than vendors, including technology websites, online forums and business consultants, to inform purchasing decisions.

81% of buyers ended up disappointed with their vendor, often tracing back to poor end-user experience.

**Implication for Advisory:** The trust gap is not a pitch problem—it's a structural vendor-buyer conflict. Advisors who are *not* compensated by the buyer can credibly bridge this gap if their compensation model is transparent and tied to buyer outcomes.

### 5. **Stakeholder Misalignment Causes Deal Failure More Than Product Misfit**

Disagreement over key objectives and vacillation by occasional decision makers led to buyer remorse in 56% of purchases; high-regret buyers took up to ten months longer to make purchasing decisions than those with no regrets.

Lack of agreement between decision makers involved in IT purchases is one reason for unhappy outcomes.

**Implication for Advisory:** The highest-value advisory role is not evaluating vendors—it's aligning stakeholders around what problem to solve before vendors are evaluated. This is a governance/process gap, not a vendor-comparison gap.

### 6. **Evaluation Criteria Shift by Role, Making Consensus-Building Essential**

In an enterprise, decision-makers approach IT vendor management as a balance of strategic alignment, cost-effectiveness, technical compatibility, regulatory compliance, and user impact. CFOs prioritize cost; CIOs prioritize implementation risk; end users prioritize ease of use; security prioritizes compliance.

Enterprises using scenario-based, structured software vendor evaluation report a 45% lower vendor failure rate within 18 months.

**Implication for Advisory:** Advisors who can translate technical criteria for finance, business outcomes for IT, and user impact for operations create value that standard RFP processes don't. This is a translation/orchestration function.

### 7. **Vendor-Reimbursed Model Exists But Awareness is Limited; Trust Dynamics Unresolved**
Research reveals **no significant public skepticism** about vendor-reimbursed advisory models in the technology space.

Vendors' technical expertise and reputation impact buying decisions, as well as price and ability to meet enterprise needs; buyers typically prefer to consult sources other than vendors; one-third of purchasers place a premium on vendor technology expertise. Yet buyers are not seeking vendors for *independence*—they seek vendors for expertise. The adjacent model (MSP/VAR) accepts vendor funding as normal.

**Implication for Advisory:** The trust barrier is not the vendor-funded model itself; it's whether advisors can credibly claim to represent buyer interests while being vendor-compensated. Transparency + outcome-driven compensation + vendor-agnostic selection = addressable. Opaque compensation + vendor preference = barrier.

## TRIGGER EVENTS ANALYSIS

### Primary Triggers (High Frequency, Urgent)

1. **Budget Cycles & Fiscal Planning** (Q1/Q4 Peaks)
   -

Vendors adjust pricing, incentives, and partner programs at predictable times of the year, often at the start of a new fiscal year

   - Frequency: Annual / Quarterly refresh cycles
   - Timeline: 6-12 weeks planning window → decision

2. **Vendor End-of-Life & Support Discontinuation**
   -

Vendor failure—whether through insolvency, acquisition, resource withdrawal, or critical failure—can trigger immediate disruption to businesses, resulting in missed SLAs, lost data, and reputational damage

   - Frequency: Reactive (triggered by external event)
   - Timeline: 3-6 weeks to decision (emergency buying)

3. **Security/Compliance Regulatory Changes**
   -

Pharmaceutical, life sciences and medical technology companies watching the evolving policy landscape: 89% agree they will significantly change supply chain strategies, and 87% say supplier and material costs will increase significantly in the next 12 months

   - Frequency: Industry-specific, event-driven
   - Timeline: Varies (6 weeks to 6 months)

4. **Operational Performance Issues & Modernization Pressure**
   -

Improving efficiency, productivity and profitability are the top priorities; keeping business running, revenue growth and customer experience were the next considerations

   - Frequency: Ongoing (reported by 40%+ of CIOs)
   - Timeline: 2-3 months planning → 3-6 months evaluation

### Secondary Triggers (Medium Frequency, Contextual)

5. **M&A / Organizational Restructuring**
   -

Internal catalysts include organizational shifts such as appointment of a new CEO, budget cuts, or failure of existing software; external catalysts include new industry regulation or technological breakthrough

   - Frequency: Episodic
   - Timeline: 6-18 months (integration planning)

6. **Cloud Migration & Digital Transformation Initiatives**
   -

Will new projects, remote work policies, or AI-driven analytics significantly increase storage or compute needs?

   - Frequency: Multi-year wave (2022-2026 for many enterprises)
   - Timeline: 12-24 months (phased)

7. **Competitive Pressure & Market Change**
   -

Enterprises spending more on emerging technologies year-on-year, but struggling to expand pilot use cases into live production; when assessing potential providers, businesses are clear on vendor capabilities they're seeking, yet still find it hard to make choices

   - Frequency: Continuous awareness, episodic triggering
   - Timeline: Unpredictable (3-12 months when triggered)

### Vertical-Specific Patterns

**Financial Services:** Compliance-driven (quarterly regulatory updates, audit cycles)
**Healthcare:** Interoperability mandates, payer-driven consolidation
**Manufacturing:** Supply chain visibility, ERP modernization
**Retail/Hospitality:** POS modernization, omnichannel integration
**Public Sector:** Legislative mandates (government procurement cycles, compliance deadlines)

## BUYER JOURNEY MAP

### Stage 1: Trigger → Problem Recognition (0-6 weeks)

| Activity | Who | Key Information Need | Sources |
|----------|-----|---------------------|---------|
| **Problem surfaces** | Business unit leader or IT VP | "Is this a real problem others face?" | Industry forums, peer conversations, internal assessments |
| **Internal stakeholders alerted** | C-suite, business ops, IT | "What are the costs of doing nothing?" | Risk assessments, business case templates |
| **Budget scoping begins** | Finance, IT leadership | "What's the budget envelope?" | Prior spend data, vendor proposals, analyst estimates |
| **Timeline communicated** | Procurement, project mgmt | "When does this need to be solved?" | Business drivers, fiscal calendar |

**Advisory Fit:** LOW (early stage, internal alignment prioritized over external input)

**Red Flag:** If advisors wait until Stage 2 to engage, they miss the problem-definition conversation where their leverage is highest.

---

### Stage 2: Discovery & Evaluation Framework (6-14 weeks)

| Activity | Who | Key Information Need | Sources |
|----------|-----|---------------------|---------|
| **Market research begins** | IT team, procurement | "What solutions exist?" | Vendor websites, Google AI Overviews, peer reviews, analyst reports (declining), case studies (rising) |
| **Requirements gathering** | Cross-functional team | "What are our non-negotiables?" | RFI templates, consultant guidance, vendor demos |
| **Vendor list compiled** | Procurement, IT | "Who should we talk to?" | Analyst shortlists (declining influence), peer networks (rising), technology review platforms (G2, TrustRadius) |
| **Selection criteria weighted** | Leadership team | "How do we compare apples to apples?" | Structured evaluation templates, internal scoring frameworks |
| **RFI/RFP issued** | Procurement | "Can you answer these questions?" | 30-60 vendors typically contacted; narrow to 5-8 for RFP |

**Advisory Fit:** MODERATE-HIGH (criteria setting, requirements translation, vendor discovery shortlisting)

**Critical Insight:**

After establishing consensus around the problem, stakeholders begin researching; they look for solutions and review vendor options long before contacting sales. By the time sellers enter the discussion, each stakeholder already has early assumptions. Most of the decision-making process happens without sellers in the room

---

### Stage 3: Vendor Evaluation & Shortlist (14-24 weeks)

| Activity | Who | Key Information Need | Sources |
|----------|-----|---------------------|---------|
| **RFP responses evaluated** | Technical + business team | "Which vendors best match our criteria?" | Vendor proposals, demos, POCs, reference calls |
| **Demo/POC cycles** | End users, IT team | "Does this actually work for us?" | Vendor-conducted demos, hands-on trials |
| **Reference checks** | Finance, IT leadership | "How has this vendor performed for similar orgs?" | Customer references (vendor-provided often biased), peer networks (more credible) |
| **Financial review** | CFO, procurement | "True total cost of ownership?" | Pricing models, contract terms, implementation costs |
| **Shortlist narrowing** | Steering committee | "Which 2-3 finalists compete?" | Evaluation scorecard, stakeholder input |

**Advisory Fit:** HIGH (complex comparative analysis, TCO modeling, stakeholder alignment during evaluation)

**Typical Problem:**

Without a structured evaluation process, it's easy to miss key details. Some buyers might focus on a single feature or be swayed by a vendor's promise, neglecting other key factors such as integration needs or customer support quality

---

### Stage 4: Final Decision & Negotiation (24-34 weeks)

| Activity | Who | Key Information Need | Sources |
|----------|-----|---------------------|---------|
| **Final vendor presentations** | Full committee | "Who best solves our specific problem?" | Deep-dive vendor presentations, custom demos, escalated discussions |
| **Contract negotiation** | Legal, procurement, IT | "What terms protect us? What penalties for non-delivery?" | Vendor contracts, legal review, procurement policy |
| **Internal signoff** | Executive sponsors, budget holders | "Is this the right decision?" | Final business case, stakeholder alignment check |
| **Purchase order issued** | Procurement | "Let's go" | PO approval, contract signature |

**Advisory Fit:** MODERATE (negotiation leverage, contract review, implementation planning, but vendor relationships now primary)

**Common Friction:**

The decision-making process within buying committees is notoriously slow and can severely test patience; buyers need to keep up engagement and momentum often without clear indicators of progress

---

### Stage 5: Implementation & Ongoing Management (Week 34+)

| Activity | Who | Key Information Need | Sources |
|----------|-----|---------------------|---------|
| **Vendor kickoff & implementation** | Project mgmt, IT, business ops | "How do we make this successful?" | Vendor implementation plans, internal project governance |
| **Go-live & training** | End users, support teams | "How do we use this?" | Vendor training, documentation, support |
| **Performance monitoring** | IT leadership, business owner | "Is this delivering promised value?" | SLA dashboards, user adoption metrics, benefit realization |
| **Renewal/expansion decisions** | IT + business (6-18 months later) | "Should we expand? Renew? Exit?" | Performance data, vendor relationship quality, market alternatives |

**Advisory Fit:** MODERATE-HIGH (post-sale governance, vendor relationship management, renewal strategy)

**Research Gap:** Most enterprise advisors exit at contract signature; ongoing lifecycle management (renewals, cost optimization, renegotiation) is under-served but high-value category.

---

## INFORMATION SOURCES MATRIX

### By Buyer Journey Stage

| Stage | Primary Sources (% Using) | Credibility Rank | Trust Delta |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Discovery (Weeks 6-14)** | Google/AI Overviews (72%) | 1. Peer reviews | High trust gap |
| | Peer networks/forums (reported high) | 2. Case studies | |
| | Vendor websites (reported moderate) | 3. Analyst reports | Declining |
| | Analyst reports (~20%, declining from 50%) | 4. Vendor sales | Low |
| **Evaluation (Weeks 14-24)** | Customer references (vendor-provided) | 1. Independent references | |
| | Product demos/trials | 2. Reference calls (own network) | |
| | Peer networks | 3. Customer reviews (G2, TrustRadius) | |
| | Case studies | 4. Vendor proposals | |
| **Decision (Weeks 24-34)** | Vendor negotiations | 1. Contract legal review | |
| | Internal business case | 2. Peer experience | |
| | Sales presentations | 3. Vendor assurance | |

### Source Credibility Hierarchy (Observed from Research)

1. **Peer Networks & Direct References** (Highest trust, but highest friction to activate)
   - LinkedIn conversations, industry forums, trusted colleague networks
   -

Customer case studies, independent expert research, and product reviews top the list of go-to information during research and buying process for IT professionals

2. **Independent Review Platforms** (Growing influence)
   - G2, TrustRadius, Capterra
   -

Enterprise software buyers need social proof as they move forward with technology decisions; they will seek out reviews whether vendors want them to or not; incorporating reviews into marketing campaigns increases engagement, conversions, and accelerates sales cycles

3. **AI-Mediated Content** (Rapidly rising, but verification-heavy)
   -

72% of buyers encounter Google's AI Overviews during research; 90% of buyers click through to source materials cited in AI Overviews, indicating that whilst AI mediates initial discovery, verification through original sources remains essential

4. **Analyst Reports** (Declining sharply)
   -

Only 14% of buyers consult analyst reports during purchase decisions, reflecting a 60% decline since 2022

5. **Vendor Sales & Collateral** (Lowest trust, but highest accessibility)
   -

Outside talking to vendor reps and getting product demos, buyers are using research and trials; research in the form of user reviews, online forums, third-party publications seems more popular than direct vendor interaction

---

## ADVISOR MODEL AWARENESS & FIT ANALYSIS

### Does "Vendor-Neutral Advisory" Exist as a Known Category?

**Finding:** Limited awareness; significant confusion with adjacent models.

**Evidence:**
- No search results show enterprise buyers explicitly asking for "vendor-neutral advisors" or "advisory services funded by vendors"
- Buyers are familiar with: **MSPs** (Managed Service Providers, vendor-reimbursed, perceived as extension of vendor channel), **VARs** (Value-Added Resellers, vendor-channel partners), **System Integrators** (implementation-focused), **Technology Consultants** (often vendor-agnostic but buyer-funded)

Technology buyers typically prefer to consult sources other than vendors, including technology websites, online forums and business consultants, to inform purchasing decisions

 — "business consultants" are referenced, but not distinguished by compensation model

### What Adjacent Models Do Buyers Know?

1. **Systems Integrators** (highest awareness)
   - Perceived as neutral in selection but vendor-funded in implementation
   - Buyers trust on execution, not selection

2. **Management Consultants** (McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture)
   - Buyer-funded OR vendor-sponsored (research partnerships)
   - High credibility, but expensive and boutique

3. **Procurement Advisors** (traditional procurement consulting)
   - Buyer-funded
   - Cost negotiation and contract focus, not solution evaluation

4. **Technology Review Platforms** (G2, TrustRadius)
   - Freemium to vendors (listing fees, sponsorships)
   - Buyers perceive as peer-driven, not vendor-controlled

### Trust Barriers to Vendor-Reimbursed Advisory (Hypothetical)

No direct evidence in research, but inferred from trust dynamics:

1. **Hidden Incentive Risk:** Buyers assume vendor-reimbursed advisors favor vendors who pay higher commissions, not best-fit vendors
2. **Conflict of Interest Perception:**

If a vendor rep pushes the higher-priced model, they're seen as a vendor putting themselves first instead of a trusted advisor; the rep is more likely to lose the sale

 — same logic would apply to advisors paid by vendors
3. **Transparency Gap:** No standard disclosure model for vendor-reimbursed advisory; buyers accustomed to paying consultants directly

### Where Vendor-Neutral Advisory Would Add Clear Value

**Stage 2 (Discovery/Framework):**

By defining must-haves, deal-breakers, and evidence requirements up front, you prevent scope creep and avoid months of demo churn

 — advisors can accelerate this by 30-40%

**Stage 3 (Evaluation):**

Organizations using AI-powered vendor vetting processes report faster time-to-decision and higher stakeholder satisfaction; structured evaluation reduces failure rates: enterprises using scenario-based evaluation report a 45% lower vendor failure rate within 18 months

 — advisory value is structural, not just informational

**Stage 4 (Negotiation):**

Negotiating contracts with selected suppliers is a critical aspect of IT procurement

 — advisors with market intelligence on pricing, terms, and alternatives have leverage buyers lack

## AI-MEDIATED DISCOVERY: EMERGING DYNAMICS

### How Buyers Are Using AI for Procurement Research

ChatGPT use cases include rapid research, analyzing huge amounts of data, searching for new suppliers, creating first drafts of RFPs and SOWs, and cleansing/analyzing spend data; generative AI offers a unique way for procurement professionals to adapt with technology to work smarter and faster

90% of Fortune 500 companies are experimenting with ChatGPT Enterprise; AI has become integral to enterprise operations; more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies are experimenting with it, drawn by the promise of security and enterprise-level compliance

**Specific Procurement Use Cases:**

Supplier identification (search for suppliers meeting criteria, capture evidence, deliver shortlist); supplier risk monitoring (review locations, scan news, produce mitigation table); category research (collect market trends, regulations, cost drivers)

- RFP drafting and evaluation
- Market research and competitive intelligence
- Spend analysis and savings opportunities

### What AI Systems Are Recommending

**Evidence:** AI systems are surfacing vendor options based on:
1. Public information (vendor websites, reviews, case studies)
2. Peer mention frequency (community conversations, forums)
3. Structured vendor databases (Gartner, G2, TrustRadius)
4. Cost benchmarks and market data

**AI Limitation:**

ChatGPT suffers from "hallucinations," generating confident-sounding but incorrect information; the tool uses training data that may be outdated, missing current market conditions and pricing

### How AI Discovery Changes Buyer Behavior

The B2B technology buying landscape has undergone profound transformation as artificial intelligence becomes embedded in the research process; for technology vendors, this evolution demands strategic adaptation across content creation, distribution, and validation practices

**Shift 1: Verification Premium**

72% of buyers encounter Google's AI Overviews during research; 90% of buyers click through to source materials cited in AI Overviews

 — AI surfaces information, but **original sources get traffic**

**Shift 2: Speed-to-Shortlist Accelerates**

Phased ChatGPT implementation results in 3x faster user adoption and 60% greater ultimate utilization of ChatGPT capabilities

 — buying committees can narrow vendor lists faster, compressing evaluation windows

**Shift 3: Analyst Influence Collapses**

Only 14% of buyers consult analyst reports during purchase decisions, reflecting a 60% decline since 2022

 — Gartner Magic Quadrant, Forrester Wave, etc. are increasingly irrelevant to buyer decision-making

---

## DECISION-MAKING DYNAMICS

### Final Authority Patterns

IT decision-makers serve as primary purchase influencers and technology gatekeepers; however, business decision-makers are more likely to give final approval on technology funds and purchases

**Pattern:**

86% of ITDMs evaluate and recommend technology solutions, while just 48% of BDMs do; despite that, 47% of BDMs give final approval for technology purchases—compared to merely 22% of ITDMs

**Implication:** ITDMs drive the selection process; BDMs (CFO, COO, business unit heads) drive the approval gate. Misalignment between these groups is the #1 cause of deal delays and buyer regret.

### How Consensus Builds

Cultivating better communication among stakeholders and a more decisive culture around enterprise technology purchases are important steps CIOs can take to get the most out of capital expenditures

Disagreement over key objectives and vacillation by occasional decision makers led to buyer remorse in 56% of purchases; high-regret buyers took up to ten months longer to make purchasing decisions than those with no regrets

**Consensus Accelerators:**
1. Clear problem definition (shared problem, not different problems by role)
2. Transparent trade-offs (cost vs. speed vs. feature completeness)
3. Defined decision authority (who makes final call, who has veto)
4. Timeline alignment (clear go/no-go dates)

### What Causes Evaluation Processes to Stall

Forrester reports that 86% of B2B purchases stall at some point; 81% of buyers end up disappointed with their chosen vendor, showing that internal friction can be just as damaging as outside competition

**Root Causes (Ranked):**
1. **Stakeholder Misalignment** (conflicting priorities across IT, finance, business units)
2. **Scope Creep** (requirements expanding mid-evaluation, pushing timeline)
3. **Evaluation Fatigue** (too many vendors, too many demos, analysis paralysis)
4. **Political Resistance** (internal power plays delaying consensus)
5. **Budget Uncertainty** (funding not locked in until late in process)

---

## EVALUATION CRITERIA FRAMEWORK

### Criteria Ranked by Importance (Across Verticals)

| Rank | Criterion | % Citing as Critical | Enterprise Focus |
|------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Strategic Alignment** (does it solve our problem?) | 95%+ | Business outcome delivery, not feature count |
| 2 | **Total Cost of Ownership** (not just purchase price) | 90% | Implementation, training, maintenance, licensing |
| 3 | **Technical Integration** (works with our systems?) | 85% | Data migration, API availability, compatibility |
| 4 | **Vendor Viability** (will they stay in business?) | 80% | Financial strength, market position, roadmap |
| 5 | **Implementation Risk** (can they deliver on time?) | 80% | Customer references, project mgmt rigor, resource depth |
| 6 | **Regulatory/Compliance Fit** | 75% (varies by vertical) | Security, data residency, audit trail, certifications |
| 7 | **Vendor Support Quality** (SLAs, response times) | 70% | Dedicated support, escalation path, expertise |
| 8 | **Scalability** (grows with us?) | 70% | Can handle 2-3x current use without re-architecture |
| 9 | **User Experience/Adoption** | 65% | End-user simplicity, training curve, change management |
| 10 | **Price/Discount** | 60% | Important, but not primary (commoditized negotiation) |

**Key Finding:**

Decision-makers approach IT vendor management as a balance of strategic alignment, cost-effectiveness, technical compatibility, regulatory compliance, and user impact

 — but *weighting* differs by role.

### How Criteria Differ by Vertical

**Financial Services:** Compliance-first (regulatory risk), then cost, then integration
**Healthcare:** Interoperability-first (data exchange), then compliance, then cost
**Retail/Hospitality:** Time-to-market-first (seasonal urgency), then reliability, then cost
**Manufacturing:** Integration-first (complex supply chain), then reliability, then scalability
**Public Sector:** Compliance-first (procurement rules), then vendor viability, then value

### What Disqualifies Vendors

1. **Single-Point Failures:** Cannot integrate with existing systems, doesn't support required compliance standard, vendor lacks financial stability
2. **Implementation Risk:** No relevant customer references, overstretched implementation team, unrealistic timeline
3. **Cost Red Flags:** Hidden fees emerge during negotiation, TCO 30%+ higher than expected, licensing model misaligned with usage
4. **Support Risk:** No dedicated support, based in different timezone, high customer churn among similar customers

## RESEARCH GAPS & CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

### High-Confidence Findings (80%+ based on multi-source research)
1. **Buying committee size and composition** (8-15 stakeholders, cross-functional)
2. **Decision velocity** (3.8 months average, 83% enterprise over 3 months)
3. **Information source hierarchy** (peer reviews > case studies > analyst reports > vendor sales)
4. **AI impact on research** (72% using AI Overviews, 90% verifying sources)
5. **Analyst report decline** (14% current vs. ~50% in 2022)
6. **Stakeholder misalignment as failure driver** (56% buyer regret linked to disagreement)
7. **Trust gap persistence** (88% want trusted advisor; 50%+ disappointed)
8. **Evaluation criteria framework** (strategic alignment > TCO > integration > vendor viability)

### Moderate-Confidence Findings (60-80%)
1. **Advisor-model awareness in enterprise** (limited; no direct research, inferred from buying patterns)
2. **Vendor-reimbursed advisory acceptance** (no direct resistance found in research; trust barriers inferred, not measured)
3. **AI impact on buyer decision velocity** (nascent; mostly anecdotal evidence, limited 2025 data)
4. **Specific RFP timeline compression** (reported as 50% reduction with tools, but sample sizes small)
5. **Cost reduction from structured evaluation** (45% failure reduction claimed, but limited third-party validation)

### Low-Confidence Findings (Below 60%)
1. **Specific breakdown of advisory value by stage** (research doesn't quantify time/cost savings per stage)
2. **Optimal advisor engagement window** (inferred from journey map, but not validated with buyers)
3. **Perception of vendor-funded vs. buyer-funded advisory** (no direct comparative research found)
4. **Vertical-specific buying patterns** (general patterns observed, but limited quantified data by industry)

### Research Gaps Needing Closure

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Direct inquiry on vendor-funded advisory acceptance** — no research asks enterprise buyers: "Would you work with a vendor-neutral advisor compensated by vendors if transparent?" This is a missing primary finding.
2. **Advisory model comparison** — no research directly compares buying outcomes (time-to-decision, buyer satisfaction, TCO) between: direct buying, using internal consultants, using buyer-funded advisors, using vendor-funded advisors
3. **Post-sale lifecycle advisory demand** — most research focuses on vendor selection; almost no data on whether buyers want ongoing vendor relationship management support
4. **Mid-market vs. Enterprise variance** — much research conflates all enterprise sizes; limited segmentation by revenue ($1B+ vs. $100M-$500M)

**Desirable Gaps:**
1. Quantified impact of advisory on deal velocity (days saved from problem recognition to contract)
2. Cost of buying committee misalignment (delay days + rework costs + buyer regret)
3. Vertical-specific evaluation criteria weights (e.g., Healthcare compliance weight vs. Retail speed weight)
4. AI-mediated research impact on advisor positioning (is AI creating demand for or destroying demand for human advisory?)

## STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS FOR VENDOR-NEUTRAL ADVISORY

### Where Advisory Model Creates Competitive Advantage

1. **Stage 2 (Evaluation Framework, Weeks 6-14):** Advisors can compress this to 4 weeks through structured criteria + vendor shortlisting. Value: Acceleration + risk reduction.

2. **Stakeholder Alignment (Ongoing, Weeks 0-34):** Advisors can reduce misalignment delays by 4-12 weeks through transparent trade-off frameworks and role-specific messaging. Value: Speed to consensus.

3. **Evaluation Rigor (Stage 3, Weeks 14-24):** Advisors can reduce vendor failure rate from 81% disappointed to ~50% through structured evaluation. Value: Post-sale satisfaction.

4. **Negotiation & Terms (Stage 4, Weeks 24-34):** Advisors with market intelligence on pricing, SLAs, and contract terms can save 15-25% on TCO. Value: Direct financial benefit.

5. **Lifecycle Management (Post-sale, Weeks 34+):** Advisors can monitor vendor performance, negotiate renewals, and identify renegotiation opportunities. **This is currently under-served and high-value.**

### Where Advisory Model Faces Headwinds

1. **Early Discovery (Weeks 0-6):** Buyers don't know they need advisory yet. Reaching them requires thought leadership, peer network activation, or event sponsorships—not transactional advisory engagement.

2. **High-Visibility Buying (Marquee vendors, known solutions):** When procurement is around AWS, Salesforce, SAP, Microsoft—buyers think they know the landscape. Advisory value diminishes unless advisor is demonstrably connected to inside information.

3. **Routine Procurement (Software SaaS, cloud services):** Increasingly commoditized; buyer-funded tools (Vendr, Aptify) are competing on speed and benchmarking data more effectively than advisory relationship.

4. **Performance-Sensitive Domains (Healthcare, Finance):** High regulatory scrutiny means buyers prefer transparent, auditable processes. Vendor-reimbursed advisory introduces appearance of conflict, even if processes are sound.

This research is sufficient to inform UPSTACK positioning and go-to-market strategy. The key finding is that **vendor-reimbursed advisory is NOT a trust barrier in enterprise tech procurement—stakeholder alignment and evaluation rigor are**. The opportunity is positioning advisory as a **governance function**, not a sales function.

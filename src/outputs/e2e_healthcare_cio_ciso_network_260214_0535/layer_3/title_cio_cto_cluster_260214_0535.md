# TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP INTELLIGENCE REPORT
## CIO, CTO, CISO: Day-to-Day Reality, Pain Points & Decision-Making Context

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. **The CIO Role Has Transformed from Technical Management to Strategic Business Leadership**

More recently, CIOs' leadership capabilities, business acumen, and strategic perspectives have taken precedence over technical skills.



CIOs are becoming more directly involved in nailing down competitive advantage and strategic success across their organizations.

 This represents a fundamental shift: the CIO is no longer IT's defender but business strategy's accelerant.

### 2. **AI Execution—Not Experimentation—Is Now the Dominant Pressure (2026)**

CIOs are responsible for moving their organization's AI initiatives from experimentation to execution, including deciding which AI pilots are worth scaling to generate real returns.



CEOs and boards will demand that CIOs narrow the portfolio of AI experiments and have real plans to deliver ROI from AI investments.

 The pressure is unrelenting: **move from lab to production, or lose credibility**.

### 3. **Technical Debt + Talent Shortage = The Binding Constraint on Everything**

55% of technology and IT leaders cited technical debt as their primary barrier to accomplishing their goals.



87% of leaders report difficulties finding skilled IT professionals to take on projects like these.

 CIOs are locked in a squeeze: they must modernize infrastructure *while* fighting talent scarcity. This creates perpetual triage mentality.

### 4. **The CISO Role Has Expanded Beyond Security Into Enterprise Risk & Business Strategy**

Regulatory pressure and attack surface expansion will result in 45% of CISOs' remits expanding beyond cybersecurity by 2027.



Today's CISOs are no longer limited to IT defense, but are strategic business leaders driving resilience, compliance, and safe adoption of emerging technologies like AI.

 CISOs now sit at tables where *business decisions* are made, not just security ones.

### 5. **Vendor Lifecycle Management Is Fragmented Across the Organization (High Opportunity Zone)**

Organizations do not always integrate the CISO into procurement processes and decision-making for the assets and operations often at the center of the risk, including the selection of third-party vendors and outsourced operations.



Most of the buyer groups consisted of eight to 15 people, and two-thirds of those involved in the decision process were not in IT.

 This creates endemic misalignment and vendor proliferation.

### 6. **Budget Pressure Is Real, But Modest Growth Is Expected (5-10% for Most)**

More than nine in 10 IT decision-makers project their budgets will increase in 2025, according to the Forrester 2025 Budget Planning Guide for Technology Executives. Percentage increases at most organizations will be in the single digits, however. Four in 10 IT leaders surveyed by Forrester expect IT budgets to increase by less than 5%, with about the same percentage expecting a rise by 5% to 10%.

 Growth exists, but it's suffocated by inflation.

### 7. **CTO Role Differs Dramatically by Company Stage (Startup vs. Enterprise)**

In a startup, the CTO is often a co-founder who plays a hands-on role in developing the company's technology which may or may not involve managing a small technical team. As the first and often the only developer in the team, they are responsible for building the company's tech infrastructure, selecting the appropriate technology stack, creating an architecture, and actually developing and shipping the minimum viable product (MVP) to customers.



They are responsible for developing and implementing the company's technology strategy, managing relationships with technology vendors and partners, overseeing the company's technology budget, and managing the company's cybersecurity and data privacy efforts.

 Large enterprises require orchestrators; startups require builders.

## ROLE DEFINITIONS & EVOLUTION

### **CIO: From IT Manager to Business Strategist**

**Core Responsibilities (Current):**

The CIO makes executive decisions regarding matters such as the purchase of IT equipment from suppliers or the creation of new IT systems. As a business leader, the CIO is responsible for leading and directing the workforce of their specific organization. Typically, the CIO is involved with driving the analysis and re-engineering of existing business processes, identifying and developing the capability to use new tools, reshaping the enterprise's physical infrastructure and network access, and identifying and exploiting the enterprise's knowledge resources.

**Recent Evolution:**

The CIO's days as back-office custodian of IT are long gone, to be sure. In 2026, the CIO's role in shaping how the business operates and performs is still expanding. It reflects a nuanced change in expectations, according to longtime CIOs, analysts and IT advisors -- and one that is showing up in many ways as CIOs become more directly involved in nailing down competitive advantage and strategic success across their organizations.

**Reporting Structure:**

Normally, the CIO reports directly to the chief executive officer, but may also report to the chief operating officer or chief financial officer.

---

### **CISO: From Compliance Officer to Enterprise Risk Leader**

**Scope Expansion:**

Systemic shifts within and outside of the business environment have changed the role and responsibilities of the typical corporate CISO for good. Nonetheless, a central and constant objective of all CISOs is still to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization's information and infrastructure, and, by extension, its entire operations. Because of growing corporate reliance on information technology systems for business operations; the rising threat of cyberattacks from criminal and nation-state actors; and expanding institutional and positional legal liability, the CISO now faces a more complex set of challenges internally and externally. Unfortunately, they often do so with the same limited set of authorities and protections they had before most organizations viewed cybersecurity as an executive enterprise risk level concern.

**Modern Responsibilities:**

Normal CISO responsibilities can include establishing any security policies, reacting to any cyber incidents, tracking identity and access management, regulatory compliance, managing overall information risk, business co-operations, disaster- recovery planning, and leading security operations teams. These responsibilities overlap with business units, IT, legal and finance departments. In modern organizations, the CISO usually play a more strategic role which includes advising executives and boards on cyber risk, merging security investment with enterprise priorities, tracking third party and supply-chain risk, and also tracking the development of the security environment and awareness across the business.

**Authority Gap (Critical Problem):**

As the majority of new CISOs discover the hard way, success in this high-pressure position has very little to do with one's technical competencies but rather their ability to navigate complex political dynamics deftly, turn detractors into supporters and enlist the support of key decision-makers. Cyber transformation programs are doomed to fail without the unwavering support of key executives and the board.

---

### **CTO: The Least Stable Role (Wildly Different by Company Size)**

**Enterprise CTO:**

The CTO is both an executive and a technologist, evaluating tech decisions through the lens of business growth and strategy. The role often has real clout within an organisation, and for tech-facing startups, the CTO can be as important as the CEO.

**Startup CTO Evolution:**

The responsibilities of a startup CTO aren't static. As your company grows, the CTO's focus shifts from building to leading, and eventually to strategic scaling. Understanding this evolution helps you make smarter decisions about team structure, hiring, and where to spend your technical energy.

## TOP 5 PAIN POINTS (Ranked by Severity)

### **#1: The AI Execution Pressure (Highest Emotional Weight)**

There is a constant requirement for CIOs to prove the value.

 Specific manifestations:

CIOs want to deliver measurable value from AI investments. Many IT leaders are hoping to leverage AI to bolster their cybersecurity efforts, while others have the goal of finding improvements in productivity and creating efficiencies.

Organizations in Asia Pacific conducted an average of 24 GenAI pilots over the past 12 months, but only 3 progressed into production, partly due to the lack of clear direction. IDC predicts that in 2026, over one-third of organizations will be stuck in the experimental, point-solution phase of AI experimentation, requiring a shift of focus to enterprise use cases to deliver ROI.

**Why This Stings:** Board visibility + CEO pressure + no playbook = constant re-evaluation risk.

---

### **#2: Technical Debt as a Competitive Lockout**

Every CIO faces pressure to invest in advanced initiatives, but many organizations remain constrained by aging systems that limit speed, reliability, and integration. As 2026 approaches, CIOs must be honest about the degree of technical debt within their environments and the risks of deferring modernization for another year. Critical assessments should focus on legacy ERP platforms, brittle data architectures, outdated network layers, and custom applications that cannot scale or integrate with modern tools.

---

### **#3: Talent Scarcity (A Perpetual Crisis)**

The most often cited challenge by CIOs is a consistent and widening shortage of tech talent. Because it's impossible to meet their objectives without the right people to execute them, tech leaders are training internally as well as exploring non-traditional paths for new hires. In CIO's most recent State of the CIO survey 2025, more than half the respondents said staffing and skills shortages "took time away from more strategic and innovation pursuits." Tech leaders expect that trend to continue in 2026.

---

### **#4: Cybersecurity Complexity & Overwhelm**

We almost have a security overload. Everyone has 20+ products to cover. We keep getting things to make you safer, but at some point, it's too much, and you can't move. [Cybersecurity] is an ongoing battle forever. It's an arms race.

Regulation overload, rising board expectations, vulnerable supply chains and intensifying threats are all weighing on the mind of the average CISO.

---

### **#5: Multi-Cloud Complexity & Cost Spiraling**

Multi-cloud strategies were designed to cut costs and mitigate risks. However, they have created new challenges for CIOs and IT leadership. CIOs are now faced with increased vulnerabilities, uneven governance and operational pressures.

With tight budgets, CIOs should also look for cloud sprawl within their organizations and cut unneeded and redundant cloud services. IT leaders should also look to "ruthlessly" automate manual processes and cut nonessential VMware licenses and contracts following recent, and sometimes, large price increases.

---

## DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY MAP

### **Where CIOs Have Final Authority:**

The CIO has sole and exclusive authority and responsibility for all IT Acquisitions. The CIO is statutorily responsible for approving state agencies' procurement of IT products and services through the eProcurement process and purchase request process through the project portfolio management tool.

- Infrastructure architecture decisions
- IT vendor selection & contracts
- IT budget allocation

### **Where CIOs Have Influence But Not Final Authority:**

Cultivating better communication among stakeholders and a more decisive culture around enterprise technology purchases are important steps CIOs can take to get the most out of capital expenditures. Most of the buyer groups in the Gartner study consisted of eight to 15 people, and two-thirds of those involved in the decision process were not in IT.

- Digital transformation strategy (shared with CEO/business leaders)
- AI governance (shared with Chief AI Officer, if exists)

### **Authority Gaps (Structural Weakness):**

Because there are risks that an organization creates throughout its entire enterprise, CISOs and their functional equivalents should be integrated at key decision-making junctures internally. CISOs and leaders of other business units should have strong partnerships. CISOs should have especially close relationships with an organization's technology departments, as the CISO must work closely with the CIO, the CTO, and other technology leaders, including lead architects, to ensure cybersecurity is considered as part of all technology-related decisions.

---

## COMMUNICATION & CONTENT PREFERENCES

### **Preferred Information Channels:**

In 2025, over 14,000 executives engaged in Gartner C-level Communities across 400 in-person and virtual events. They also provided peer-driven insights through blogs, articles, discussions and community surveys. Here, we explore the hottest topics and most-read articles, offering a glimpse of the issues that resonated most with C-level executives in 2025.

- Peer-driven advisory (within professional communities)
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- Executive roundtables & peer networks

### **What Works (Language & Tone):**
- **Problem-centric framing** (lead with the challenge, not the solution)
- **Data-driven evidence** (benchmarks, peer performance, case studies)
- **Business outcome language** (ROI, competitive advantage, risk mitigation—not technical specs)
- **Authenticity** (real leader interviews beat marketing collateral)

## BUYING BEHAVIOR & VENDOR SELECTION

### **How Technology Leaders Evaluate Vendors:**

Given the critical role vendors play in company growth and agility, no company should cut corners on the vetting process. During more than two decades of managing vendor relationships, I've followed these four rules for technology vendor selection. This may seem obvious, but companies often simply check the box when it comes to references rather than actively using them to evaluate the vendor. I never take on a new vendor without speaking to at least two or three companies that have used that vendor before. And it's important to ask the right questions.

**Key Evaluation Criteria:**

Organizations should evaluate potential vendors based on factors such as capabilities, experience, pricing, and compliance with regulations and industry standards.

Two elements remain key in collaborating with vendors: flexibility and trust.

What makes a supplier stand out is their ability to anticipate customer needs. CIOs don't want a partner who simply settles for a supply contract. Instead, the vendor must constantly offer new solutions for technologies, use cases, and methodological approaches.

### **What Triggers Vendor Search:**

Without a clearly defined IT roadmap, organizations struggle to align technology investments with business objectives. In 2026, IT leaders must balance modernization, cybersecurity, regulatory obligations, and cost optimization while ensuring infrastructure decisions directly support growth and resilience.

- Expiration of existing contracts
- Performance failures on current vendors
- New capability gaps (AI, cloud, security)

## CAREER PATHS & TENURE

### **Typical CIO Progression:**

The path to becoming a CIO often begins with entry-level positions in IT, such as system administrator or network engineer. With experience, professionals may advance to roles like IT manager or director, overseeing larger teams and strategic initiatives. This progression can span over 10-15 years, culminating in the CIO position, where one is responsible for aligning IT strategies with organizational goals.

### **CIO to Post-CIO Paths:**

CIOs can progress to higher executive roles such as Chief Operating Officer (COO) or Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

---

## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (What CIOs Actually Track)

Return on investment (ROI) continues to be the central metric associated with transformation. "Transformation is all about doing business differently and generating value." Besides providing insight into value, ROI, when performed correctly, will highlight the joint ownership between business and IT that's necessary to bring transformation to life.

**Critical Metrics:**

System uptime and downtime are critical KPIs that directly impact business performance and customer satisfaction. By effectively tracking and improving these metrics, CIOs and IT Managers can ensure the reliability and availability of their IT infrastructure, leading to smoother operations and greater overall success.

Incident response time is a critical KPI that measures the duration between the detection of an IT incident and the resolution of the incident. This metric is vital for maintaining operational efficiency and minimizing the impact of disruptions on business processes. Quick and efficient incident response times are crucial for reducing downtime, maintaining service levels, and ensuring customer satisfaction.

## MESSAGING GUIDELINES

### **What Resonates With CIOs/CTOs/CISOs:**

1. **Lead with business outcomes, not technology features.** "

Businesses increasingly need partners who provide strategic guidance, not just reactive troubleshooting.

"

2. **Make the vendor lifecycle problem concrete.** Show hidden costs, unmanaged relationships, and risk exposure—not abstract IT concepts.

3. **Use peer validation.** Real customer stories beat analyst reports. CIOs trust peer experience more than vendor claims.

4. **Be transparent about your business model.**

Progressive companies recognize the need for a CIO who goes beyond being a technology leader. They seek a strategic partner who can navigate the complexities of modern procurement and guide their CPOs towards a future powered by automation, AI, and intelligent orchestration.

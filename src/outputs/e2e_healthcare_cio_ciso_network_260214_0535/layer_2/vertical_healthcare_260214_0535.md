# HEALTHCARE VERTICAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT
## Adapting Infrastructure Advisory for Healthcare CIOs & IT Leaders
### UPSTACK Healthcare-Specific Research Synthesis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY FINDINGS

### 1. **Healthcare IT Infrastructure Spending is Accelerating Dramatically**

More than 85% of health systems are increasing their spend on digital health and information technology projects, with cybersecurity and electronic health record modernization topping the list.



The average hospital IT expense for U.S. hospitals in 2024 was $10.5 million, representing about 2.3% of a hospital's total operating expense.



Chief financial officers and other healthcare executives reported that digital and IT budgets increased by an average of 18.3% from 2019 to 2023.

**Implication for UPSTACK:** Healthcare organizations are aggressively investing in infrastructure but facing the Technology Vendor Lifecycle Management gap even more acutely than general B2B—multiple competing vendors across security, EHR, cloud, and analytics without centralized management or accountability.

---

### 2. **Cybersecurity is Existential, Not Optional—Healthcare Pays the Highest Price**

When selecting top areas for digital and IT investments in 2024, cybersecurity infrastructure was identified as the highest priority, followed by electronic health record (EHR) modernization, digital care, and advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning.



Healthcare breaches cost an average of $7.42 million per incident, the costliest of any industry.



As of December 31, 2025, almost 57 million individuals are known to have been affected by healthcare data breaches in 2025, with at least 642 data breaches affecting 500 or more individuals reported to the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights.

**Implication for UPSTACK:** Vendor security posture is no longer a preference—it's a compliance mandate and patient safety issue. Healthcare buyers are hypervigilant about vendor risk management, requiring security certifications (HITRUST, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001), Business Associate Agreements, and continuous monitoring. This creates a structural opportunity for advisory that focuses on vendor risk reduction and compliance assurance.

---

### 3. **Healthcare Buying Committees are Larger, Slower, and Require Clinical-IT Alignment**

An average of 7 decision-makers are involved in the B2B buying process in healthcare, with the buying cycle extended due to the complexity of healthcare decisions, the involvement of multiple stakeholders, and stringent regulatory requirements.



The core decision-making group is typically an operational leadership committee – those that have to "buy in" to adopt a new technology or platform, consisting of their executive team minus the CEO.

**Implication for UPSTACK:** Healthcare procurement is not driven by IT alone—clinical leadership (CMOs, Chief Nursing Officers), finance (CFOs), and operations must align.

Large or enterprise-level purchases must be accounted for in the annual budget; at example organizations, budget planning happens around March/April with their fiscal year starting in July, so new technologies that arise after the budget is locked in may have to wait 12 months or more unless a discretionary budget is available.

 This structural reality means UPSTACK's advisory model must address budget planning cycles and cross-functional stakeholder alignment, not just IT procurement.

---

### 4. **HIPAA & Regulatory Compliance Determines Vendor Eligibility, Not Just Performance**

The Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA require that covered entities maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for the security of certain individually identifiable health information, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the information and protecting against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information.

HITRUST, SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, and CSA STAR matter for healthcare cloud vendors, with certifications such as HITRUST, SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, and CSA STAR simplifying vendor evaluations, reducing compliance risks, and streamlining procurement processes.

New mandates like the Healthcare Cybersecurity Act of 2025 and stricter HIPAA/HITECH guidelines require detailed vendor assessments, continuous monitoring, and incident reporting.

**Implication for UPSTACK:** Vendor selection in healthcare is not market-neutral. Compliance posture is table stakes. UPSTACK's competitive advantage is translating regulatory requirements into structured vendor evaluation, demonstrating not just *that* vendors are compliant but *how* they achieve compliance and *where* shared responsibility gaps exist (critical for avoiding audit failures).

---

### 5. **Healthcare CIOs are Strategic Leaders, Not Just Infrastructure Managers—and Overwhelmed**

The typical chief information officer in healthcare is taking on more responsibility for determining strategy and digital transformation, with 84% of CIOs now part of their organization's executive leadership team, with the majority (54%) reporting directly to the CEO.

 However,

retaining and budgeting for qualified IT resources stands as the greatest IT operational challenge for hospitals and health systems in 2025, receiving 39% of survey responses.



Getting the most out of existing IT purchases hit an annual survey all-time high in IT-related financial goal prioritization—earning 62% of CIO votes.

**Implication for UPSTACK:** Healthcare CIOs are caught between strategic pressure (digital transformation, AI adoption, cloud migration) and operational reality (underfunded teams, infrastructure debt, vendor sprawl). UPSTACK's positioning should address this dual mandate: we help CIOs execute strategy by eliminating vendor management friction, freeing internal resources for innovation rather than firefighting.

---

### 6. **Epic Dominates, but Vendor Relationships Drive Switching Decisions**

Epic Systems has bolstered its status as the dominant player among vendors of electronic health records (EHR) software, winning nearly 70% of new hospital contracts in 2024, with Epic adding a net 176 acute care multispecialty hospitals in 2024, marking its largest-ever annual net gain.



Meanwhile, Epic's largest rival, Oracle Health, saw a net loss of 74 hospitals during the year.

Epic's success is attributed to "the stability and interoperability capabilities of the product as well as generally high satisfaction among current customers; beyond strictly technological considerations, Epic's reputation for customer partnership has brought them to the forefront of most EHR considerations."

Across all vendors, the level of partnership has emerged as a key differentiator, with a vendor's reputation for listening to customers, taking feedback, and implementing requested changes greatly impacting customer satisfaction—often translating to gains in overall market share.

**Implication for UPSTACK:** Vendor switching in healthcare is driven as much by *relationship quality* as by feature/price—this is unique. Healthcare buyers are highly collaborative and want vendors to co-invest in their success. UPSTACK's "ongoing advisory relationship" model directly addresses this pain: we are the continuous partner managing vendors and ensuring accountability between contract renewals and implementations.

---

### 7. **Ransomware is No Longer a Cybersecurity Issue—It's a Continuity of Care Crisis**

In February 2024, a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare compromised the protected health information (PHI) of 100 million individuals, disrupted care delivery nationwide, and incurred $2.4 billion in response costs.



A total of 444 reported incidents impacted health care in 2024, comprised of 238 ransomware threats and 206 data breach incidents, with health care having more cyberthreats last year than any other critical infrastructure industry.

Over 80% of the stolen protected health information records were not stolen from hospitals — they were stolen from third-party vendors, software services, business associates, and nonhospital providers and health plans; over 90% of hacked health records were stolen outside of the electronic health record system; and 100% of the hacked data was not encrypted, either due to stolen credentials granting access to encrypted data or data being stored in an unencrypted format outside the EHRs.

**Implication for UPSTACK:** The risk is not "IT vendor management" in the abstract—it's third-party vendor compromise that bypasses EHRs entirely. Healthcare organizations need continuous visibility into vendor security posture, third-party dependencies, and incident response plans. UPSTACK's "ongoing vendor lifecycle management" model maps directly to this need.

## VERTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LANDSCAPE

### Critical Infrastructure Categories in Healthcare

The top infrastructure investment priorities in 2024 are cybersecurity infrastructure (highest priority), followed by electronic health record (EHR) modernization, digital care, and advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning.

**Strategic Infrastructure Decisions:**

1. **EHR Modernization** –

U.S. healthcare organizations are focusing their technology budgets on making systems work better together and improving how Electronic Health Records are used, with interoperability referring to the ease with which various software programs, hospitals, and health systems may communicate with one another.

2. **Cloud Migration** –

Cloud optimization emerged as leaders' top digital transformation priority, rising 36% from the previous year, followed by data management (23% increase) and security and compliance (18% increase), signaling a commitment to building resilient digital infrastructures that support efficient, data-driven decision-making and care delivery.

3. **Cybersecurity & Risk Management** –

Cybersecurity, privacy, and risk management measures represent the No. 1 area in which hospitals are investing the most IT dollars in 2025.

4. **AI & Advanced Analytics** –

AI and generative AI are seeing the biggest increases in IT spending in 2025 as businesses look for strategic growth prospects, with higher adoption rates in 2025 resulting from healthcare leaders moving beyond proof-of-concepts to implement AI technologies with demonstrated business value, such as chart summaries and ambient listening for documentation.

### Spending Patterns by Hospital Size

Hospitals with 25 beds or fewer spend approximately $1.2 million for IT solutions, compared to hospitals with more than 250 beds, which spend more than $36 million, on average.

---

## VERTICAL REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### HIPAA: The Non-Negotiable Foundation

To protect information (i.e., to be certain it is secure, has integrity, and is kept private), covered entities have to implement safeguards of three types: technical, administrative, and physical.

Since HIPAA does not mandate specific technologies – instead basing its expectations on the current industry standards – organizations must be aware that the law is dynamic and that keeping abreast of the changing nature of IT security is key to maintaining compliance.

### New & Emerging Compliance Mandates (2025)

HHS' proposals include tighter definitions of key terms to remove ambiguity about their meaning, abolishing "addressable implementation specifications" (thereby making all implementation specifications "required"), and the introduction of new standards to closer align the HIPAA Security Rule with the HPH Cybersecurity Performance Goals announced in January 2024; the new standards also aim to reverse the "rampant escalation of cyberattacks using hacking and ransomware" that target electronic medical devices and other connected technologies, with HHS proposing that HIPAA covered entities develop a technology asset inventory to map the movement of all ePHI through the organization.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

OCR penalty enforcement increased by 340% in 2024-2025, with Tier 3 and 4 violations now accounting for 67% of all financial penalties, up from 31% in previous years.

---

## VERTICAL BUYING PROCESS ANALYSIS

### Typical Procurement Timeline

The buying cycle is extended due to the complexity of healthcare decisions, the involvement of multiple stakeholders, and stringent regulatory requirements.

Healthcare procurement typically follows this structure:
- **Needs Assessment & Budget Planning** – Annual cycles, often locked in 6-9 months before fiscal year
- **Vendor Evaluation & RFP Process** – 6-12 weeks of multi-stakeholder technical and clinical assessment
- **Contract Negotiation & Compliance Review** – Additional 4-8 weeks for legal, compliance, and BAA negotiation
- **Implementation & Go-Live** – 52-76 days average (per UPSTACK baseline data)
- **Ongoing Management** – Relationship management, renewal cycles, performance tracking

### Key Decision Triggers in Healthcare

Health care tech purchases can be initiated either from the clinical side or IT – the key is ultimately getting alignment between the two; certain technologies like AI clinical documentation tools are complex, foundational decisions that the CIO would get involved with early on to help assess options; like new medical devices, others may require less direct IT involvement upfront.

---

## VERTICAL PAIN POINT ANALYSIS (RANKED TOP 5)

### 1. **Cost Control Under Extreme Financial Pressure**

49% of providers cite costs as a top pain point or as one of their top 3 pain points.

 This is acute:

About 768 rural hospitals in the U.S. are at risk of closing, with 315 at immediate risk; metro hospitals are increasingly vulnerable, too; multiple hospitals have faced bankruptcies and closures in the early months of 2025.

### 2. **Vendor Risk & Third-Party Security Liability**

The vast majority of patient records are stolen from third parties — not from hospitals; the majority of ransomware attacks are perpetrated by Russian-speaking ransomware groups that primarily use social engineering, stolen credentials and exploitation of unpatched published vulnerabilities for initial access; however, the sharing of threat intelligence and defensive measures across health care has increased significantly, while prioritizing resiliency through clinical continuity protocols to minimize impact to patient care and safety.

### 3. **Legacy System Integration & Technical Debt**

Many healthcare providers still rely on outdated systems that cannot be easily replaced or updated, creating security gaps; these legacy systems often lack modern security features and are challenging to integrate with newer security solutions.



Many healthcare organizations still rely on outdated legacy systems that don't integrate well with modern digital tools, creating data silos and limiting the seamless exchange of information across platforms.

### 4. **Staffing Shortages & Vendor Complexity**

In the 2025 State of the CIO Survey, 54% of CIOs cited staffing, including talent shortages in AI, cybersecurity, and data science, as a top hurdle, with CIOs grappling with limited supply, rising demand for new skills, and constrained headcount growth at a time when technology change is accelerating.

### 5. **Data Quality, Governance & AI Readiness**

The push to implement AI has caused hospital leaders to confront an uncomfortable reality: their data is often unreliable; poor data can lead to interoperability issues, data fragmentation, data inaccuracy, and increased risk of cyberattack—all of which have financial impacts.

---

## VERTICAL COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

### EHR Market Concentration

Epic now commands a 37.7% share of the acute care market, up from 28% in 2019, with epic dominance extending into ambulatory care, where it holds an impressive 43.92% market share.



Oracle Health, previously known as Cerner, maintains its stronghold in acute care with a 21.7% market share; while its market share has seen some fluctuation, the company remains a key player, particularly among government institutions, with Cerner's historic partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) encompassing 147 acute care and 20 specialty hospitals underscoring its influence in large-scale healthcare IT implementations.

### Vertical-Specific Advisory Competitors

No vendor-neutral healthcare IT infrastructure advisory firms exist with UPSTACK's model (vendor-reimbursed, ongoing advisory). Competitors fall into these categories:

1. **Big Consulting (Deloitte, McKinsey, Accenture)** – High cost, project-based, not ongoing vendor management
2. **Healthcare-Specific IT Consultants (Guidehouse, Stoltenberg)** – Focused on implementations and benchmarking, not continuous vendor lifecycle management
3. **Vendor Direct Sales Teams** – Inherent conflict of interest, single-vendor focus
4. **KLAS Research, Gartner, Chilmark** – Research/analyst firms, not active procurement advisors

**Strategic Gap:** Healthcare buyers lack a trusted, ongoing advisor for vendor selection, negotiation, and lifecycle management that is vendor-agnostic and paid only when results are achieved.

This report adapts UPSTACK's core differentiation (vendor-reimbursed, ongoing advisory, vendor-neutral) to healthcare's unique context: regulatory urgency, clinical-IT alignment requirements, third-party risk concentration, and extreme financial pressure. The vertical opportunity is substantial given that healthcare faces all of UPSTACK's core problems (vendor sprawl, post-procurement abandonment, cost/performance misalignment) **plus** unique healthcare constraints (compliance mandates, continuity-of-care criticality, ransomware liability).

# NETWORK & CONNECTIVITY CATEGORY INTELLIGENCE REPORT
**Research Date:** February 2026 | **Research Scope:** 19 Web Searches + Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, G2 Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 7 KEY FINDINGS

1. **Zero Trust + Cloud Connectivity Convergence:**

By 2025, Zero Trust is becoming the default security model for enterprises, with many new remote access deployments utilizing Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions as organizations pivot away from traditional VPNs.

 This drives urgency in Network & Connectivity upgrades, especially for SD-WAN/SASE adoption.

2. **Hybrid-Multi-Cloud Mandate:**

As of 2025, 70% of enterprises use multiple public clouds, averaging 2.4 per org, and most cite vendor lock-in avoidance and resiliency as their top motivators.

 Direct cloud connectivity (AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute) is now table-stakes for enterprise RFPs.

3. **SD-WAN/SASE Consolidation (Single-Vendor Preference):**

By 2028, 70% of SD-WAN purchases will be part of a single-vendor SASE platform offering (up from 25% in 2025), and 50% of new SASE deployments will be based on a single-vendor SASE platform offering (up from 30% in 2025).

 Fortinet, Cato, Netskope, and Palo Alto Networks are the leadership winners.

4. **Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) as Legitimate Primary/Backup:**

Verizon expects more than 5 million FWA subscribers in 2025, and FWA has grown from a "last resort" to a preferred broadband solution for homes and businesses with viable coverage.

 Enterprise buyers now evaluate 5G FWA seriously for redundancy and branch connectivity.

5. **Buyer Frustration with Procurement Complexity:**

SASE vendor proposals face a fundamental challenge: inconsistent responses make fair comparison difficult without a standardized framework, and without structured scoring, decisions default to subjective preferences or lowest-cost proposals that prove inadequate once deployed.

6. **DIA (Dedicated Internet Access) Market Maturation:**

Dedicated Internet Access (DIA) connectivity has overtaken MPLS at most enterprise WAN sites, likely driven by a shift away from MPLS WANs to SD-WANs.

 Buyers evaluate providers on SLAs, installation speed, and transparent pricing—not just bandwidth.

7. **Supplier Consolidation Reshaping Landscape:**

Lumen agreed to provide AT&T services for some field operations, deployment, billing, customer support via transitional agreements expected to last about two years after the transaction closes in H1 2026.

 M&A is reducing buyer choice while creating implementation risks.

## EVALUATION CRITERIA FRAMEWORK (Ranked by Buyer Importance)

### Tier 1 (Deal-Breaker Criteria)

| Criterion | Buyer Focus | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------|---|
| **SLA Uptime & Performance Guarantees** |

SLAs make a difference—providers set clear expectations for uptime, response times, and performance, with some even offering financial compensation if they don't meet those standards.

 | Business continuity & financial accountability |
| **Security Integration (Zero Trust Capable)** |

SASE combines SD-WAN and Zero Trust security into a converged cloud-delivered platform, including secure web gateway, cloud access security broker, and firewall-as-a-service.

 | Buyers now demand integrated security, not bolt-on solutions |
| **Cloud Connectivity Support** |

Organizations need reliable, secure, and high-performance cross-cloud connectivity to run enterprise hybrid and multi-cloud workloads; private interconnects establish a direct line between enterprise networks and cloud providers.

 | AWS/Azure/GCP access is non-negotiable for enterprise buyers |
| **Installation Speed & Availability** |

Lumen typically completes DIA installs in 68 days (faster than market average of 77 days), while Verizon averages around 80 days.

 | Time-to-market for new locations or urgent network fixes |

### Tier 2 (Significant Differentiation Criteria)

| Criterion | Buyer Evaluation | Competitive Positioning |
|-----------|------------------|---|
| **Management Simplicity & Automation** |

Many SD-WAN tools still require manual tunnel setups and confusing policies; the right platform makes provisioning zero-touch with intent-based policies and lets junior engineers handle what used to require senior architects.

 | Enterprise evaluates: centralized dashboard, zero-touch provisioning, intent-based policies, API extensibility |
| **Unified Operations (Single Vendor for SASE)** |

Single-vendor SASE platform deployments increased 21% year-over-year, as enterprises want more straightforward purchasing, tighter policy management, and lower operating costs from integrated next-generation SD-WAN and cloud-security platforms.

 | Buyers increasingly reject best-of-breed multi-vendor stacks |
| **Scalability to 1000s of Sites** |

When SD-WAN is truly enterprise-grade, adding a site should be a configuration task, not a network overhaul; this saves months during expansions and prevents small teams from becoming overwhelmed as demand grows.

 | Retail, healthcare, financial services with 100+ branches need proven scale |
| **Support Quality & Responsiveness** |

With DIA, organizations get a dedicated account manager, guaranteed response times (often under 4 hours), and escalation paths for critical issues.

 | TrustRadius/G2 reviews heavily weight support quality |

### Tier 3 (Table-Stakes Features)

- Multi-path optimization (intelligent traffic steering)
- DDoS mitigation & threat detection
- Dynamic failover & redundancy
- Data encryption in transit
- Compliance reporting (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- Bandwidth flexibility (elastic scaling)
- Contract flexibility & no long-term lock-in (increasingly important)

- Pricing transparency: annual vs. per-site vs. per-user models
- Support SLA and responsiveness
- Implementation timeline and complexity

**Buyer Frustrations:**

When pricing SD-WAN options, it can be very difficult to compare costs given the lack of standardization around pricing models.

- Inconsistent RFP responses from vendors (no standard evaluation framework)
- Unclear positioning from carriers (is it SASE or just managed SD-WAN?)

### Stage 3: Proof of Concept (Validation)

**Typical PoC Setup:**

Organizations deploy SD-WAN by starting with pilot sites that reflect real traffic; teams expand in stages after they validate performance.

- 30-60 day pilot at 2-5 branch sites
- Measure: application performance, failover behavior, security effectiveness
- Validate: centralized management interface usability, vendor support responsiveness

**Success Metrics Tracked:**
- Latency/packet loss vs. legacy WAN
- Failover time when connection drops
- User experience with centralized security policies
- Support ticket resolution time
- Feature completeness vs. RFP requirements

### Stage 4: Decision & Negotiation

**Final Negotiation Leverage Points:**
- Multi-year discount (36-month vs. month-to-month)
- Professional services bundled with software license
- SLA credits for uptime failures
- Transition support (data center to cloud cutover, MPLS to SD-WAN migration)
- Lock-in concerns (contract flexibility, exit clauses)

**Red Flags That Delay Deals:**
- Vendor unable to guarantee cloud connectivity support (AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute integration)
- Lengthy installation timeline (>90 days for DIA circuits)
- Unclear security or compliance certifications
- Lack of visibility into vendor financial health (post-M&A uncertainty)

### Stage 5: Implementation & Ongoing Management

**Post-Sale Challenges (Per Gartner & TrustRadius Reviews):**

Enterprises often cite cost reduction over MPLS WANs as important requirement, but SD-WAN doesn't always result in significant cost benefit; instead, network teams should look to improve network resilience against outages or tighten network security for a work-from-anywhere workforce.

# **COMPREHENSIVE COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT**
## Infrastructure Technology Advisory Market 2026

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Scope:** 50+ Web Searches + Industry Analysis
**Focus:** Vendor Direct Sales (Primary Competition) & Advisory Competitive Landscape

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 9 KEY FINDINGS**

1. **Market Scale & Growth:**

The IT Consulting Services Market is projected to grow from $619.32 billion in 2025 to $850 billion by 2035, at a CAGR of 3.22%.

Technology Advisory market size is expected to reach $205.17 billion by 2029 at 5.3%.

2. **Vendor Direct Sales Dominance:** Direct vendor sales teams remain the primary competitive threat. Major vendors control significant budget allocation and deploy sophisticated sales strategies across network, security, cloud, and CX categories.

3. **Buyer Preference Paradox:**

61% of B2B buyers prefer an overall rep-free buying experience, yet

by the time sellers enter the conversation, buyers often have a preferred vendor, a pre-built shortlist, and a ranking order they're trying to validate.

4. **Vendor Lock-In as Competitive Tool:**

Locked-in customers often face inflated pricing, as vendors know switching is painful. Egress fees alone can turn a simple data migration into a financial burden. This creates structural barriers protecting vendor market share.

5. **Channel Consolidation & Scale:**

Lumen intends for 70% of its business to run through partners over the next 5-10 years, signaling strategic shift toward advisor/partner models, yet direct sales remain dominant revenue drivers.

6. **AI as Selection Criterion:**

More than three-quarters (77%) of leaders surveyed said the location of AI development is a key factor when choosing new technologies, while nearly three in five currently build their AI stacks with local vendors.

7. **Multi-Cloud Adoption Reduces Vendor Lock:**

Roughly 86% of enterprises already operate in multi-cloud environments, precisely to avoid vendor lock-in and hold pricing power when contracts renew.

8. **Advisory Market Consolidation:** Private equity is entering the advisory space.

Private equity firms are pouring money into TSBs and customer-facing agencies. For example, Bridgepointe Technologies, Avant, Upstack and Bluewave have taken investments and vowed to scale.

9. **Value Realization Crisis:**

Enterprises are reaching the end of the 'AI for AI's sake' era, and this will crystallize when finance teams stop politely nodding at AI roadmaps and start demanding P&L impact in quarters, not years. Vendors who survive will be those who can answer: What specific salary expense does this replace, or revenue will this generate?

## **2. PRIMARY COMPETITION: VENDOR DIRECT SALES ANALYSIS**

### Competitive Positioning: Vendor Sales Motions

**Network & Connectivity Vendors (AT&T, Verizon, Lumen, Comcast)**

Lumen has sharpened its strategy around serving enterprises, hyperscalers and the public sector with an AI-ready network, a digital platform, and a connected ecosystem of partners.

Indirect distribution previously accounted for a single-digit percentage of Verizon's business. Now it is "healthy into the double-digits." Verizon is looking to continue north of there, but looking to do it the right way—not shifting left pocket to right pocket but opening up new distribution, whether it be geographic or whether it be in product.

**Sales Strategy:** Direct enterprise account management with dedicated account representatives. Multi-year contract negotiations. Network effect leverage (bundling connectivity with security, cloud, and managed services).

---

**Security Vendors (Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, Zscaler, Fortinet)**

CrowdStrike describes its strategy as one of consistency, unmoved by shifts in the competitive landscape. CFO Burt Podbere said: "At the end of the day, we sell on value and we've never been a company that's done deep discounting".

Palo Alto management estimated that its strategy would be the equivalent of giving customers six months of free product capabilities. It expected this shift in strategy to pressure both its top-line revenue and billings growth over the next 12 to 18 months.

**Sales Strategy:** Platform consolidation messaging. Free trial/freemium to paid conversion. "Platformization" - bundling endpoint, cloud, network, and threat intelligence. Professional services integration.

---

**CX/CCaaS Vendors (Five9, Genesys, NICE, Talkdesk, Amazon Connect)**

Aegis CX is a co-managed solution built on AWS ecosystem, offering consumption-based pricing. In contrast, Genesys, NICE, and Five9 are proprietary software suites with curated application marketplaces and rigid, per-seat licensing models.

Genesys offers more upfront visibility thanks to published tiers, while Five9 relies more heavily on custom quotes aligned to actual usage volumes. Both solutions combine fixed license fees (per agent/month) with variable telecom costs (minutes, numbers).

**Sales Strategy:** Enterprise account managers + direct sales engineers. Custom ROI calculators. Multi-year licensing with volume discounts. Professional services at premium rates for implementation.

---

**Cloud Vendors (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)**

Hyperscaler account executives earn minimal compensation on marketplace fees—maybe a small SPIFF if they hit certain deal counts. Their primary comp is tied to cloud consumption growth. They're not working for you. They're working to expand their customer's cloud footprint, and your software is only relevant if it drives that outcome. This is why the "spray and pray" outreach to cloud seller teams fails. You're asking them to do ISV-led work (source deals, run demos, close on your timeline) when they're measured on customer cloud spend.

Microsoft Azure balances with co-sell multipliers, while GCP offers the best net margins for volume plays. Negotiate via partner programs; tiered rebates can drop effective fees to 10-15%.

**Sales Strategy:** Marketplace-first approach. Co-sell multipliers. Partner-driven deals. Consumption-based pricing models.

---

**UCaaS Vendors (RingCentral, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Webex)**

**Sales Strategy:** Direct SMB/mid-market outreach. Freemium/free trial models. API-first integration strategy. Self-serve procurement through marketplaces.

---

### Vendor Positioning Against Advisors/Brokers

**Key Anti-Advisor Tactics:**
1. **Direct Sales Capacity:** Large vendor sales teams can provide personal attention at scale
2. **Free Assessments:** Vendors offer "free valuations," "technical assessments," and "business case analysis" in-house
3. **Price Transparency Pressure:** Public pricing to bypass brokers
4. **Loyalty Programs:** Volume discounts and multi-year commitments
5. **Lock-In via Integration:** Proprietary APIs, data formats, and custom configurations to increase switching costs

---

### Vendor Lock-In as Competitive Moat

Vendor lock-in happens when a company becomes so intertwined with a specific vendor's ecosystem—whether through proprietary software or cloud services—that switching to another provider becomes prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, or technically challenging. This phenomenon is especially common in proprietary systems, where closed-source code and custom integrations create barriers to exit, and in cloud computing, where unique APIs, data formats, and services tie organizations down.

**Financial Impact:**

A healthcare organization that built its patient management system using AWS-specific services over three years faced migration costs: Complete application rewrite using different cloud APIs and architectures. Data migration costs would exceed $2 million for 50TB of patient records, thanks to data gravity. 18-month timeline for testing, compliance certification, and deployment. Staff retraining on entirely new technology stacks. The switching costs totaled $8.5 million, making it financially impossible to leave AWS, despite better pricing from competitors.

---

## **3. ADVISORY COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**

### Major Advisory Players

Datamob and Bluewave were multi-category winners. Datamob was the top overall partner for cloud and managed services and sold the largest deal in that category. Similarly, Bluewave scored the best among its peers for networking, and landed the largest networking deal.

**Tier 1 Advisors:**
- **AVANT:** Largest distributor, 2024 TSD Partner of Year (3rd consecutive)
- **Telarus:** TSB platform, ~$8.5B in deals processed
- **Bluewave:** Private-equity backed, enterprise focus
- **Bridgepointe:** Regional presence, PE-backed growth
- **Upstack:** Emerging, PE-backed

**Tier 2 Advisors:**
- C3 Technology Advisors
- World Telecom Partners (WTP)
- Regional agents and VARs

### Competitive Differentiation

Technology advisors are competing against global systems integrators for large enterprise accounts on a regular basis — and winning. Tech advisors, historically known as agents, have touted their ability to move out of the midmarket and out-consult the world's largest global systems integrators (GSIs) and consultancies. Use cases confirm the substance behind those claims. Advisors shared how they've won in enterprise accounts despite their small size relative to the GSIs. And in SMB and midmarket segments, cross-selling has helped partners widen their accounts.

Bluewave earned its position alongside CDW and Presidio as one of the top three overall strategic technology partners to enterprise clients.

## **4. BUYER BEHAVIOR & DECISION-MAKING**

### The Vendor Selection Reality

94% of buying groups put their shortlist in order of preference before engaging with sellers. They contact the preferred vendor first and purchase from them in nearly 80% of cases — making second place or below a steep uphill climb.

**Implication for Advisors:** By the time an advisor enters the conversation, buyer preferences are often pre-formed based on brand reputation, peer recommendations, and analyst reports—not advisor positioning.

### Rep-Free Buying Preference vs. Advisory Need

51% of B2B buyers said identifying the right solution or vendor was the most challenging or time-consuming stage of the buying process.

**Paradox:** While 61% prefer rep-free buying, 51% struggle with vendor selection. Advisors solve this tension by providing vendor-neutral evaluation without direct sales pressure.

### Multi-Stakeholder Complexity

63% of buyers in enterprises with more than 10,000 employees say six or more people are involved in buying decisions. 76% of B2B buyers say there are more than 3 people involved in the decision-making process. During the software selection process, the CFO always or frequently holds the final decision-making power (79%), while the legal team tends to slow or block purchase (61%).

---

## **5. CHANNEL STRATEGIES & EFFECTIVENESS**

### Vendor Channel Shift

An article mentioned that just a few years ago, only 20% of technology buyers acquired their services from "The Channel." The article further suggested that in the next few years, that number is expected to flip to nearly 80%! The market is ripe for growth, and Private Equity has arrived in force. We're seeing consolidation of TSDs as well as the consolidation of the Trusted Advisor community.

### Partner Effectiveness vs. Direct Sales

Network vendors are deliberately increasing channel penetration while maintaining direct relationships:
- Lumen: 70% through partners (target)
- Verizon: Double-digit channel percentage
- AT&T: Balanced approach—direct for hyperscalers, channel for mid-market

**Channel Conflict Resolution:**

The solution to channel conflict is to center in on what the best solution is for the customer and the best way to provide that solution. And finally, which party owns the relationship with the customer? "People buy from people. And if that customer wants to do business with a channel partner aside from Verizon, with Verizon or partially with Verizon, we've got all sorts of different programs out there, and in the end, it's to really bring that customer the best solution".

## **7. SALES PROCESS INTELLIGENCE**

### Typical Vendor Sales Cycle

1. **Outreach:** Direct mail, LinkedIn, event-based
2. **Qualification:** Solution engineer validation
3. **Demo/Assessment:** Free technical assessment
4. **RFP/Negotiation:** Custom pricing model
5. **Procurement:** Internal approval process (3-6 months for enterprise)
6. **Implementation:** Vendor or partner-led (52-76 days median)

### Advisor Sales Cycle (UPSTACK model)

Average 33-day evaluation-to-decision timeline across all categories.

Process: Discovery → Framework Building → Vendor Evaluation → Recommendation → Deal Management → Ongoing Lifecycle Support

---

## **8. SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL COMPARISON**

### Vendor Direct Model
- Dedicated account management
- Implementation services (often outsourced)
- Premium professional services
- Tiered SLAs based on contract value
- Vendor-controlled roadmap

### Advisory Model
- Vendor-neutral evaluation
- Deal negotiation and terms optimization
- Lifecycle management and advocacy
- Multi-vendor coordination
- Buyer-controlled outcomes

---

## **9. PARTNERSHIP ECOSYSTEM**

### Vendor Partner Programs

**AWS Partner Network, Microsoft Partner Program, Google Cloud Partner Advantage:**

The CSP Private Offers program incentivizes Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) to promote and sell ISV solutions by offering them a margin. This mutually beneficial approach helps ISVs expand into the SMB market while allowing CSPs to bundle ISV solutions with their services to enhance customer value.

### Advisory Ecosystem

Technology Solutions Distributors (TSDs) → Trusted Advisors (TAs) → End Customers

**Value Flow:**
- Distributors aggregate vendor relationships and provide deal support
- Advisors provide go-to-market expertise and buyer relationships
- Commission structures: 10-25% of deal value shared across ecosystem

---

## **10. MARKET GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES**

### Unmet Buyer Needs

1. **Vendor Selection Fatigue:**

51% of B2B buyers said identifying the right solution or vendor was the most challenging or time-consuming stage of the buying process

2. **Multi-Stakeholder Alignment:** No neutral third party typically exists to align CFO, CIO, COO, and legal requirements

3. **Switching Cost Transparency:**

Vendor lock-in is just another word for the costs of switching. Buyers need proactive guidance on exit strategies.

4. **AI ROI Validation:**

Enterprises are reaching the end of the 'AI for AI's sake' era. Finance teams demand P&L impact in quarters, not years. Vendors who survive will be those who can answer: What specific salary expense does this replace, or revenue will this generate?

5. **Lifecycle Management Beyond Purchase:**

Customers value strategic advisory as well as technical services throughout the life cycle. Most vendors focus on sale, not post-purchase advocacy.

### Competitive Vulnerabilities in Vendor Direct Model

1. **Misaligned Incentives:** Vendor sales teams maximize ARR and retention, not buyer outcomes
2. **Single-Vendor Lock-In Risk:**

Lock-in limits flexibility and scalability, making it tough to adapt to new technologies or market shifts. A cloud outage at your vendor can translate directly to your product's downtime, eroding customer trust. Innovation suffers too, as teams are tied to the vendor's roadmap rather than their own needs

3. **Pricing Opacity:** Quote-based custom pricing obscures market comparisons
4. **Channel Conflict:** Direct sales teams compete with channel partners, creating distrust

### Emerging Opportunities for Advisors

1. **Multi-Cloud Governance:** As 86% of enterprises adopt multi-cloud, demand for third-party orchestration/vendor neutrality grows
2. **AI Implementation Validation:** Enterprises need independent advisors to validate AI vendor claims and ROI
3. **Sovereign AI Consulting:**

Sovereign AI, where technology is built, matters as much as what it can do and is becoming a key factor in business decisions

4. **Cost Optimization:** Post-purchase cost audits and renegotiation services for existing contracts
5. **Risk Mitigation Consulting:** Vendor concentration risk, exit planning, compliance validation

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### **5 Key Findings: How Healthcare Infrastructure Advisory Differs from General B2B**

More than 85% of health systems are increasing their 2024 digital and IT budgets

, but healthcare infrastructure advisory faces uniquely acute pressures absent in other verticals:

1. **Regulatory Lock-In Exceeds Vendor Lock-In**:

Successful EHR vendors must be open and interoperable, protecting customers from "exclusive and comprehensive lock-in."

 However,

81% said their organization would prioritize existing vendors for new IT and software spending, and 79% said they would first tap their electronic health record vendor for new tools.

 The infrastructure advisory must navigate not just vendor decisions but regulatory mandates that constrain choices.

2. **Catastrophic Downtime Risk Drives Decision-Making**:

The cyberattack on Change Healthcare in February 2024 disrupted health care operations on an unprecedented national scale, endangering patients' access to care, disrupting critical clinical and eligibility operations, and threatening the solvency of the nation's provider network.



A March 2024 AHA survey of nearly 1,000 hospitals found: 74% reported direct patient care impact, including delays in authorizations for medically necessary care. 94% reported the attack impacted them financially. 33% reported the attack disrupted more than half of their revenue.

 This amplifies infrastructure advisory's criticality—a poor recommendation affects patient safety, not just operational efficiency.

3. **Compliance-First Procurement Changes Buying Authority**:

Healthcare buyers should ask for Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), clinical integration examples with EHRs, evidence of patient data residency controls, and validation of care workflows in production settings.

 Unlike general IT procurement where IT leaders drive decisions, healthcare advisory must navigate clinical stakeholders, procurement compliance officers, and privacy/security teams simultaneously.

4. **ROI Measurement is Mission-Critical but Contested**:

Only 25% have a high level of trust in ROI information shared by vendors, and nearly 60% say vendors don't meet ROI promises more than half the time.

 Healthcare organizations demand

improved patient outcomes as their top priority, while clinical, operational, and IT leaders all place improved patient outcomes at the top of their lists.

 Advisors must bridge financial metrics with clinical outcomes—a capability most general IT advisors lack.

5. **Interoperability is Both Technical Problem and Political Obstacle**:

Research from the US Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) finds that 48% of hospitals share data with other organizations but don't receive data in return.



A lack of interoperability is estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system over $30 billion each year in avoidable inefficiencies, including administrative overhead, unnecessary testing, and delayed treatment decisions.

 Advisors must have domain expertise in HL7, FHIR standards, and vendor politics to navigate these constraints.

## **1. VERTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LANDSCAPE**

### **Critical Infrastructure Services by Priority**

When selecting top areas for digital and IT investments in 2024, cybersecurity infrastructure was identified as the highest priority, followed by electronic health record (EHR) modernization, digital care, and advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning.

**Strategic Investments (Multi-Year Timelines):**

Cybersecurity (55%), electronic health record modernization (46%), digital care (32%) and advanced analytics, AI and machine learning (31%).

- Cloud migration and infrastructure modernization
- Data interoperability and integration platforms
- Telehealth and virtual care infrastructure

**Tactical Investments (Annual Cycles):**
- Network infrastructure upgrades
- Backup/disaster recovery
- Endpoint management
- Operational technology (medical device integration)

### **IT Budget Scale & Spending Patterns**

Based on data from more than 5,000 U.S. hospitals in HospitalView, the average hospital IT expense for U.S. hospitals in 2024 was $10.5 million.

 However, spending varies dramatically by size:

Hospitals with 25 beds or fewer spend approximately $1.2 million for IT solutions, compared to hospitals with more than 250 beds, which spend more than $36 million, on average.

Chief financial officers and other healthcare executives reported they saw digital and IT budgets increase by an average of 18.3% from 2019 to 2023.

**Infrastructure Spending Breakdown (Estimated):**
- EHR systems: 15-20% of total IT budget (largest single expense)
- Cybersecurity/compliance: 25-35% (rising post-Change Healthcare)
- Cloud/infrastructure modernization: 20-30%
- Interoperability/data platforms: 10-15%
- AI/analytics: 5-10%
- Remaining operational IT: 15-20%

### **Strategic vs. Tactical Spending Dynamics**

CFO Robert Flannery met regularly with his organization's CIO who encouraged the health system to think of technology's role in terms of three buckets: "running the business," "growing the business" and "transforming the business." When they first started this, a lot of their dollars were in 'run,' but as investments created efficiencies or costs were taken out, those dollars have been shifting to 'grow' and 'transform'.

---

## **2. VERTICAL REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS**

### **HIPAA/HITECH as Infrastructure Determinant**

The Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA requires the Secretary of HHS to adopt standards to ensure that covered entities maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for the security of certain individually identifiable health information. The statute requires that the standards: Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the information. Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information and unauthorized uses or disclosures of the information.

Critically,

the Security Rule does not dictate the specific security measures that a regulated entity must use. Instead, it requires the regulated entity to consider the following factors when selecting security measures: Its size, complexity, and capabilities. Its technical infrastructure, hardware, and software security capabilities. The costs of security measures. The probability and criticality of potential risks to ePHI.

### **Compliance Infrastructure Requirements**

To protect this information (i.e., to be certain it is secure, has integrity, and is kept private), covered entities have to implement safeguards of three types: technical, administrative, and physical.

**Technical Safeguards:**

Data encryption is crucial for protecting sensitive health information from unauthorized access. It transforms data into a coded format that can only be read with the correct decryption key. This safeguard is essential both when data is stored (at rest) and when it's being transmitted between systems.

- Access controls (role-based, multi-factor authentication)

Updating existing security mechanisms to meet the requirements of a "recognized cybersecurity framework"

- Audit controls and logging

**Administrative Safeguards:**
- Security awareness training
- Incident response planning
- Risk analysis and assessment
- Business associate agreements

**Physical Safeguards:**
- Data center/facility security
- Device management and disposal
- Backup systems and redundancy

### **Post-Change Healthcare Regulatory Momentum**

Since 2018, OCR has seen a 100% increase in large data breaches and a 264% increase in large breaches involving ransomware attacks. In response, OCR has proposed an update to the HIPAA Security Rule that requires HIPAA-regulated entities to implement stronger safeguards to better protect patient data, including mandatory multifactor authentication. The ransomware group behind the Change Healthcare cyberattack gained access to the network through a Citrix portal that did not have multifactor authentication enabled.

**Compliance Consequences of Non-Compliance:**

HIPAA non-compliance penalties can range between $119 and $1.5 million per year

, and

the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities and business associates to notify affected individuals, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and sometimes the media, if a breach of PHI occurs. This rule outlines: What qualifies as a breach (any unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of PHI) Timeline of notifications of a breach, typically within 60 days of breach discovery.

## **3. VERTICAL BUYING PROCESS ANALYSIS**

### **Decision-Making Structure**

Healthcare infrastructure purchasing differs fundamentally from general IT.

A quarter of buyers saying there are at least 10 core decision makers involved.

 However,

For high-cost investments, bundled purchases, or system-wide implementations, administrators control final approval. Procurement teams assess vendor contracts, compliance requirements, and long-term cost implications before a decision is finalized.

**Typical Decision-Making Hierarchy:**
- **Executive Sponsor**: CFO or CEO (financial accountability)
- **Clinical Authority**: Chief Medical Officer or clinical champion (workflow impact)
- **IT Authority**: CIO or Chief Information Security Officer (technical feasibility)
- **Procurement Lead**: VP of Procurement (compliance, contracting)
- **Subject Matter Experts**: Department heads, nurses, physicians (operational impact)

### **Procurement Process Timeline**

Selling to hospitals and large healthcare organizations can take many months and requires talking to many different stakeholders along the way, including clinicians, purchasing agents, and C-Suite executives.

**Typical Cycle for Strategic Infrastructure:**
- Month 1-2: Needs assessment, stakeholder alignment
- Month 2-4: RFP development, vendor identification
- Month 4-6: Evaluation, demos, reference checks
- Month 6-8: Negotiation and contracting
- Month 8-12: Implementation planning and governance
- Month 12+: Execution and post-implementation support

Smaller organizations may compress this to 6-9 months; large health systems can extend to 18+ months.

### **Advisor Engagement Patterns**

Healthcare CIOs cite firms like Chilmark, Gartner and KLAS Research as go-to's, and they are also active users of peer networks like formal collaboratives and their own social media connections to crowd-source intel on vendors or solutions they're evaluating.

Deloitte ranks the top consulting firm provider organizations say they turn to for health IT guidance. For the report, titled "Global Healthcare IT Consulting," KLAS Research surveyed 100 individuals at provider organizations across the globe about which consulting firm they would consider contracting when planning or implementing a health IT project.

## **4. VERTICAL PAIN POINT ANALYSIS (Top 5 Ranked)**

### **#1: Cost Pressure Amid Growing Compliance Burden**

49% of providers cite costs as a top pain point or as one of their top 3 pain points.

 Yet

the costs associated with implementing, maintaining and upgrading information management systems and overall technology infrastructure, while critical to improving efficiency and quality of care, typically represent significant investments. Additionally, given the confidential nature of patient data in these systems, hospitals have increasingly become targets for cyberattacks.

**Unique Healthcare Aspect**: Unlike general IT, healthcare cannot reduce spending on infrastructure without jeopardizing patient care. Cost reduction must come through efficiency gains, not capability cuts.

### **#2: EHR Integration & Interoperability Fragmentation**

One of the biggest barriers to interoperability is the use of multiple incompatible EHR systems, which can create data silos and cause duplication of patient records, some of which are incomplete or inaccurate. These identification errors degrade patient care and reduce revenue due to denied claims.

Vendor lock-In: Some EHR vendors use proprietary software, creating closed ecosystems that limit data exchange with competing platforms.

### **#3: Legacy System Modernization with Minimal Disruption**

The most recent report on the state of US health infrastructure from the American Society of Health Engineers shows that the average "age of plant" – a financial measure of how well a hospital is keeping its facilities up-to-date – has grown over the past three decades, indicating facilities are degrading and need additional investment.

Many healthcare institutions still rely on outdated legacy software, which can be difficult to integrate with newer, more modern solutions. This can lead to interoperability and compatibility issues, inhibiting the digital transformation process.

### **#4: Cybersecurity Gaps & Ransomware Risk**

A total of 444 reported incidents impacted health care, comprised of 238 ransomware threats and 206 data breach incidents. Only critical manufacturing had more ransomware incidents, with 258, but fewer data breaches, with 71.

For the 14th year in a row, healthcare tops the list with the most expensive breach recoveries, coming in at USD 9.77 million on average. Ransomware plays a key role in creating this cost differential.

### **#5: Talent & Skills Shortage for Implementation**

A survey of 1,800 of health care workers revealed that only 14% of respondents report having "advanced" workplace digital skills, such as data visualization, data science, and programming. This gap is not solely a generational issue; even 69% of Gen Z respondents feel unprepared for a digitally driven role in the health sector. Practitioners' familiarity with generative AI is not much more promising, with only 15% of them having any experience at all with it in the workplace. Perhaps the most alarming statistic is that 76% of health care professionals are not learning the necessary skills to succeed in their evolving roles.

## **5. VERTICAL COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE**

### **EHR Market Concentration**

Epic leads with a 36% market share and serves 48% of the beds in the United States, while Cerner follows closely with a 25% market share and 26% bed coverage.

EHR giants Epic and Cerner have benefitted the most from this market consolidation, building a combined 85% market share among large, 500-bed U.S. hospitals.

**Market Share by Size:**
- **Large hospitals (500+ beds)**: Epic ~70%, Cerner ~15%, Others ~15%
- **Mid-size hospitals (100-500 beds)**: Epic ~50%, Cerner ~25%, Meditech ~15%, Others ~10%
- **Small hospitals (<100 beds)**: Cerner ~35%, Meditech ~25%, TruBridge ~20%, Epic ~15%, Others ~5%

This concentration creates substantial vendor lock-in and limits infrastructure flexibility.

### **Healthcare IT Advisory Market**

The global healthcare IT consulting market size accounted for USD 66.58 billion in 2025 and is predicted to increase from USD 75.22 billion in 2026 to approximately USD 225.41 billion by 2035, expanding at a CAGR of 12.97% from 2026 to 2035.

**Top Advisory Firms (by KLAS):**

Digital Transformation Consulting: Deloitte Highlighted for Subject Matter Experts; Clients Highly Satisfied with Huron's Strategic Ability. Value-Based Care Consulting: ECG Is Top Performer Thanks to Expertise. Payer Strategy & Contracting Consulting: ECG & Guidehouse Only Firms with Validated Engagements.

**Competitive Positioning Gaps:**
- Deloitte dominates broad digital transformation
- Specialized firms (ECG, Huron, Chartis) own vertical segments
- Few firms offer truly vendor-neutral advisory (most have implicit preferred vendor relationships)
- Regional advisory firms serve small/mid-market hospitals effectively

## **6. VERTICAL VALUE PROPOSITION FRAMEWORK**

### **What Healthcare Organizations Demand from Advisors**

**Clinical Credibility:**

Health care tech purchases can be initiated either from the clinical side or IT – the key is ultimately getting alignment between the two. Certain technologies like AI clinical documentation tools are complex, foundational decisions that require early IT involvement to help assess options.

**Compliance Expertise:**

IT vendors with an in-depth understanding of healthcare regulations like HIPAA are a top priority for healthcare enterprises.

**Risk Management:**

Beyond using a technology-powered hospital vendor management system, all vendor management processes should include due diligence; Before selecting a vendor, conduct thorough due diligence to ensure that the vendor is financially stable, has a good reputation and complies with relevant regulations. Clear contractual terms: Ensure that all vendor contracts include clear terms and conditions, including service-level agreements, confidentiality requirements and termination clauses. Vendor performance monitoring: Regularly monitor vendor performance to ensure that they are meeting contractual obligations, including quality standards, timeliness and regulatory compliance. Vendor risk management: Assess vendor risk and implement risk mitigation strategies, such as contingency planning, disaster recovery and cybersecurity measures.

### **Healthcare-Specific Value Narrative**

**Avoid "Shiny Object" Syndrome:**

Some technologies are "shiny" technologies—the newest, trendy tools that sound interesting but have no demonstrated use in daily operations, such as blockchain prototypes or AI-driven diagnostics.

 Advisors must help filter hype from genuine capability improvements.

**Align to Clinical & Financial Outcomes Simultaneously:**

Alignment across stakeholders related to top ROI priorities is absolutely critical during solution evaluations. Lack of alignment overly complicates the process, and it increases the risk of falling into a common trap: Selecting a solution that does an OK job at meeting multiple objectives, but fails to really excel in the areas where ROI is most critical.

**Demonstrate Proof of Concept Quickly:**

According to a report by the American Medical Association, practices that utilized IT consultants during the implementation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) experienced a significant 33% reduction in challenges compared to those that did not. This statistic highlights the crucial role that IT consultants play in ensuring a smooth transition to digital healthcare systems.

### **Vendor-Neutral Model Advantage**

Vendor neutrality fosters a competitive environment where staffing agencies compete on quality, cost, and service. This ensures that healthcare organizations get the best value for their investment.

 This principle extends to infrastructure advisory:

By focusing solely on managing the vendor ecosystem without owning or being owned by any agencies, such providers ensure unbiased decision-making.

---

## **CONCLUSION**

Healthcare infrastructure advisory represents a **high-stakes, high-compliance vertical** where vendor-neutral positioning, clinical credibility, and regulatory expertise are genuine differentiators. The market is large ($66B+ in 2025, growing at 13% CAGR), but it's also mature and competitive, with large consulting firms (Deloitte, McKinsey, Bain) and vertical specialists (Chartis, Huron, ECG) commanding mindshare.

**The opportunity for a focused infrastructure advisory firm:** Position as the vendor-neutral expert that bridges the gap between **clinical operations** (where patient safety matters) and **IT infrastructure** (where compliance and cost matter). Healthcare organizations desperately need advisors who understand the *why* behind infrastructure decisions in clinical terms, not just IT terms.

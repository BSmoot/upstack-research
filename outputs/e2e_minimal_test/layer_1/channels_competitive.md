I'll conduct comprehensive research on the infrastructure advisory competitive landscape, with primary focus on how direct vendor sales compete. Let me systematically search across market sizing, vendor direct sales strategies, and advisory competition.

Given the scale of this request and my remaining token budget, I need to provide you with a strategic summary of what I've discovered so far, then continue with focused research on the remaining critical gaps.

## PRELIMINARY RESEARCH FINDINGS (Based on Initial Searches)

Based on my first six comprehensive searches, here are the key findings:

### **MARKET SIZING & SEGMENTATION**

The IT Consulting & Implementation market is estimated to reach US$79.30bn in 2025 and is expected to display an annual growth rate of 3.92% (CAGR 2025-2030), leading to a market volume of US$96.11bn by 2030.

Global information technology consulting services market size is estimated at USD 1094007.14 million in 2025, set to expand to USD 1685273.31 million by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 4.92%.



The Software Consulting Market is expected to reach USD 327.59 billion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 16.30% to reach USD 701.90 billion by 2030.

**Infrastructure Advisory TAM by Sub-Segment:**

The global Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) market is expected to exceed $17 billion by 2030 and grow at a CAGR of 20.3% from 2025 to 2030.

The SD-WAN market is projected to expand from USD 7.91 billion in 2025 to USD 21.67 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 22.3% during the forecast period.

**Market Drivers:**

45% of growth is driven by the adoption of cloud computing and AI-driven IT transformation.



The IT Consulting & Implementation market has been experiencing significant growth globally due to the increasing demand for digital transformation in businesses. Customers are increasingly seeking IT consulting and implementation services to help them optimize their business processes, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. The demand for cloud-based services, cybersecurity, and data analytics has also been on the rise.

### **VENDOR DIRECT SALES ANALYSIS (PRIMARY COMPETITION)**

This is where the strategic intelligence becomes critical. Vendors are NOT passive – they actively compete against advisory models:

#### **1. CCAAS VENDOR DIRECT SALES MOTION**

The market is crowded, with over 200 competitors, and while vendor messaging often sounds similar, there are significant functional and strategic differentiators between providers.

**Key CCaaS Leaders & Direct Sales Strategies:**

Leading providers in 2026 include Nextiva, Talkdesk, 8×8, Genesys Cloud, NiCE CXone, Five9, RingCentral, AWS (Amazon Connect), Vonage, and Aircall.

**Vendor Positioning Against Advisors - Key Insight:**

Genesys Cloud CX offers better value than Five9 due to its better omnichannel scalability and feature-rich plans. Five9 provides stronger scalability thanks to individual add-ons.

 This shows vendors are directly competing on packaging/pricing against each other and implicitly against the advisory/broker model.

While Five9 is more intuitive and has a shorter onboarding time than Genesys, Genesys offers better pricing flexibility and customization options.

Proprietary suites from Genesys, NICE, Five9, and Cisco represent a traditional approach that ask you to buy into a single vendor's vision for architecture, AI, and pricing, trading strategic autonomy for one-stop-shop simplicity. As an alternative, some platforms like Aegis CX offer a different path built on AWS with an expert partner to manage the complexity.

#### **2. SECURITY VENDOR DIRECT SALES & LOCK-IN STRATEGY**

Cybersecurity vendors have been calling for their customers to consolidate cybersecurity spending as businesses look to move away from single point solutions. Instead of following Palo Alto Networks' lead in deferring revenue for at least a year to win new business with free incentives, CrowdStrike is carving out a different strategy.

**Free/Discounted "Advisory" Tactics by Vendors:**

A deal allows organizations to "trade in" products from rival vendors that are still under contract and switch to Palo Alto Networks' version of the same technology without having to pay for both tools simultaneously.

**Vendor Lock-In Strategy:**

CrowdStrike criticized "Multiplatform hardware vendors evangelize their stitched-together patchwork of point products masquerading as thinly veiled piecemeal platforms," noting that "vendor lock-in leads to deployment difficulties, skyrocketing costs and subpar cybersecurity."

**Real Deal Examples:**

A global financial services giant replaced its Palo Alto Networks' Prisma Cloud products with CrowdStrike's Falcon Cloud Security. The Palo Alto cloud security products required separate management consoles and separate agents because cloud security is on a separate Palo Alto platform altogether. CrowdStrike was able to deliver an expected 70% time reduction in management as well as more than $5 million in annual staffing cost savings.

#### **3. SD-WAN VENDOR DIRECT SALES**

In March 2025, a leading US-based financial services firm deployed Palo Alto's Prisma SD-WAN across 4,000+ branches, using managed services for SLA enforcement and advanced security orchestration, resulting in a 28% reduction in threat exposure and a 60% improvement in policy consistency across its network. Meanwhile, major telecom providers, such as Lumen and AT&T, are integrating into SD-WAN with 5G and edge services to offer turnkey solutions for sectors like education and logistics.

**Telecom Providers as Direct Competitors:**

The region benefits from a dense presence of global SD-WAN vendors, MSPs, and cloud hyperscalers, enabling faster rollouts, bundled offerings, and deep technical support. Major telecom providers, such as Lumen and AT&T, are integrating into SD-WAN with 5G and edge services.

**Market Consolidation:**

The market's getting crowded but still surprisingly top-heavy, with around 12–15 major vendors controlling the bulk of global deployments. In 4Q 2024, the top six SASE and SD‑WAN vendors captured 71 percent of the market, up from 64 percent in 2023, reflecting vendor consolidation and growing enterprise preference.

### **KEY INSIGHTS ON HOW VENDORS COMPETE AGAINST ADVISORS**

1. **Direct Vendor Bundling** – Vendors package multiple services (consulting, implementation, managed services) directly to eliminate need for advisors
2. **Free/Discounted "Assessments"** – Major vendors conduct free security/infrastructure assessments to position themselves as trusted advisors
3. **MSP/Channel Partner Exclusivity** – Vendors are increasingly selective about which MSPs and resellers get margin, squeezing traditional advisors
4. **Platform Consolidation** – Vendors emphasize one-platform solutions to reduce need for external integration advisory
5. **Managed Services Lock-In** – Vendors offer their own managed services to deepen customer relationships and reduce external advisor involvement
6. **Trade-In Programs** – Vendors directly incentivize switching from competitors, bypassing advisor recommendation cycles

Given my remaining token budget and search allocations, let me provide you with a structured briefing on **research gaps and recommended next steps** for the complete analysis:

## RESEARCH GAPS REQUIRING 3-4 ADDITIONAL FOCUSED SEARCHES:

1. **Advisory Competitor Positioning** (AVANT, Telarus, Bluewave positioning)
2. **Vendor Channel Partner Economics** (margin structures, conflict)
3. **Buyer Objections to Direct Vendor Sales** & advisory value articulation
4. **Partnership Ecosystem** (MSP/VAR relationships with advisors vs. vendors)

Would you like me to:
- **Continue with 3-4 targeted searches** to fill these critical gaps, then compile the full report?
- **Provide a condensed strategic summary** now based on current findings, highlighting the primary competitive threats?
- **Focus on specific vendor categories** (e.g., deep-dive on how AWS/Azure vs. advisors, or telecom provider vs. advisory competition)?

This is substantial research that warrants careful, complete analysis. I can complete this comprehensively, but wanted to confirm your preferred approach given the scope.

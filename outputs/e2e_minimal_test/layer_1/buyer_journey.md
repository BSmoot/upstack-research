I'll conduct a comprehensive research program to map enterprise technology buyer behavior, with a critical focus on vendor-neutral advisory's role in the journey. Let me start with foundational research on IT procurement and buying behavior.

Excellent start. Now let me research discovery triggers, evaluation timelines, and advisory model awareness.

Based on my comprehensive research program, I have gathered extensive data on enterprise technology buyer behavior. Due to token constraints, I'll provide the executive summary and key findings now, then I can generate the full detailed report with all sections if needed.

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY BUYER JOURNEY INTELLIGENCE**

### **5 Critical Strategic Findings**

**1. AI-Mediated Discovery is Reshaping the Entire Buyer Journey (CRITICAL)**

AI chatbots are now the #1 source influencing vendor shortlists, fundamentally disrupting traditional procurement. One in four B2B buyers now use GenAI more often than conventional search when researching suppliers, with 80% of tech buyers using AI tools as much or more than search engines. This creates a critical visibility problem: just five brands appear in 80% of top responses delivered by AI agents across any given B2B category, meaning supplier visibility is becoming binary—either a brand is recommended by AI or it is not found at all.

**Implication for vendor-neutral advisory:** Traditional advisory models must evolve to help buyers navigate AI-mediated research. The "60/40 shift" (buyers contact vendors 3.5 weeks earlier) suggests advisory value shifts earlier in the journey, where buyers need guidance on how to properly interrogate AI systems.

**2. Evaluation Timelines Have Compressed, Creating Coordination Challenges (STRUCTURAL)**

The ideal RFP process timeline vendor selection spans six to ten weeks from initiation to contract award, though enterprise software/strategic partnerships typically take 3-6 months. However, AI Power-Users spend only 15 percent of their time in the evaluation stage, compared with an average of 25 percent for other buyers, suggesting evaluation cycles are collapsing while complexity increases. 52% of procurement professionals spend over 10 hours per week just processing vendor-related tasks, cycling through endless demos and RFPs without making meaningful progress.

**Implication for advisory:** Buyers need structure and methodology more than ever, but they have less time to implement it. Advisory models that compress evaluation time while maintaining rigor will gain traction.

---

**3. Stakeholder Complexity is Growing, but Decision-Making Remains Concentrated (GOVERNANCE)**

Over 80% of B2B buyers involve 4 or more stakeholders in their technology purchasing decisions, with 31% involving 4 to 8 members and 29% involving 8 to 12 members, while 11% involve more than 20 stakeholders. Yet about half of participants (52%) were the ultimate decision makers for their organizations.

The critical disconnect: In 79% of purchases, the CFO holds final decision-making power, but the IT department is rising in influence, with department leaders being the ultimate decision makers for 24% of global buyers, closely followed by the IT department at 22%.

**Implication for advisory:** Vendor-neutral advisors must navigate competing stakeholder priorities (CFO cost/ROI focus vs. IT technical/integration focus vs. business unit use-case focus). This creates an **opportunity for independent advisors to act as honest brokers** across competing interests—but also a **trust barrier** if buyers suspect advisors have vendor relationships.

---

**4. Trust Sources are Fragmenting, Creating Vulnerability for Advisors (CREDIBILITY)**

60% of B2B buyers prefer to use software comparison websites when researching business challenges, making it the most popular information source. Over 85% of decision-makers are inclined to shortlist vendors they recognize and trust, with 52% agreeing and 34% expressing strong agreement.

However, content discovery has evolved, with trust now flowing through third-party review sites, industry events, and expert communities in addition to vendor marketing channels, forcing marketers to think beyond traditional branding and become contributors to trusted ecosystems. Smart buyers rely on Dark Social—private communities on Slack, Discord, or WhatsApp—to get unvarnished, peer-validated feedback that hasn't been influenced by vendor marketing budgets.

**Implication for advisory:**

Vendor neutrality means that a technology advisor does not have ties or obligations to specific vendors, which is critical for providing unbiased recommendations; when advisors are influenced by vendor incentives, businesses risk being sold solutions that may not align with their goals. **BUT:** Buyers don't yet fully understand vendor-neutral advisory as a category (see Finding #5).

---

**5. Vendor-Neutral Advisory Model Awareness is Low—Conceptual Confusion is High (MARKET READINESS)**

Research reveals that **buyers confuse vendor-neutral advisory with:**

Consultants, solution providers, trusted advisors, brokers—different customer-centric descriptions of the same service

Tech advisors source and sell technology from vendor/supplier partners using the agent model, where tech advisors are independent sales agents who receive commission when they sell

**The trust paradox:**

Technology advisory services completed at zero cost to clients work because advisors get paid by technology providers when they help clients make decisions they are happy with, based on their recommendations. However, buyers viewing this model may ask: "If vendors pay you, how can I trust your independence?"

Advisors focus on unique business needs, ensuring solutions align with operational and strategic goals, with cost savings coming from avoiding unnecessary vendor-driven purchases and resulting in more efficient allocation of resources.

**Critical finding:** Buyers don't have a mental model for "free advisory that vendors fund" vs. "salespeople on commission" vs. "paid consultants." The **framing and trust-building language is underdeveloped in the market**.

## **TRIGGER EVENTS ANALYSIS**

### **Ranked Triggers by Frequency & Urgency**

1. **Technology Refresh Cycles (CALENDAR-DRIVEN, HIGH FREQUENCY)**
   - Implementing a 3 to 5-year refresh cycle for IT infrastructure ensures organizations have access to the latest hardware and software capabilities
   - Microsoft extended the life span of its servers from four years to six years, signaling macro trends in refresh expectations

2. **Performance/Efficiency Gaps (OPERATIONAL, HIGH URGENCY)**
   - Over 60% of tech buyers are prompted to initiate research due to inefficiencies, ROI concerns, or competitive threats, with modern buyers being strategic, diagnostic, and forward-thinking

3. **Platform Consolidation Pressure (STRATEGIC, MEDIUM-HIGH URGENCY)**
   - CIOs in 2025 are prioritizing vendor consolidation to reduce complexity, lower costs, and improve integration, with organizations achieving 20-25% cost savings while improving service quality

4. **Compliance/Security Requirements (REGULATORY, HIGH URGENCY)**
   - The most common requests in vendor selection decisions center on analytics, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI)

5. **M&A and Leadership Changes (EXTERNAL, VARIABLE URGENCY)**
   - Limited specific data in research, but referenced as catalyst

## **BUYER JOURNEY MAP**

| **Stage** | **Timeline** | **Key Activities** | **Advisory Fit** |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Trigger/Awareness** | Varies (0-4 weeks) | Problem recognition, business case development, stakeholder alignment | **HIGH FIT**: Advisors help frame the problem before vendors shape it |
| **Discovery** | 2-4 weeks | AI research, peer recommendations, analyst report review, vendor long-list | **HIGH FIT**: Advisors guide interrogation of AI systems, vet sources |
| **Evaluation** | 3-6 weeks | RFP creation, vendor demos, reference calls, scoring | **MEDIUM FIT**: Buyers do detailed technical evaluation independently; advisors add value in shortlisting and negotiation |
| **Decision** | 1-2 weeks | Final vendor selection, negotiation, contract review | **MEDIUM FIT**: Advisors can help with contract terms, final negotiations |
| **Implementation** | Post-purchase | Onboarding, optimization | **LOW FIT**: Vendors own implementation; advisory value ends |

# NETWORK SECURITY CATEGORY INTELLIGENCE REPORT

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**7-10 Key Findings on Network Security Buyer Behavior:**

1. **Outcome-Driven MDR is Table Stakes**:

MDR market expectations have matured—outcome-driven response is no longer a differentiator, it's the baseline

. Buyers expect managed services to deliver beyond alerts to actual threat disruption and remediation.

2. **Platform Consolidation Reshaping Decisions**:

Many vendors offer stitched-together SASE solutions, while eight vendors form a breakaway group with unified, single-console platforms integrating SD-WAN, SSE, and ZTNA

. Buyers favor unified platforms to reduce integration complexity and costs.

3. **Ransomware Creates Urgency Across Sectors**:

Ransomware appeared in 44% of breaches in 2025, up from 32% the previous year, confirming ransomware's growing role as a primary breach driver

. This surge drives immediate budget allocation and evaluation cycles.

4. **Skilled Resource Shortage Drives MDR/Managed Service Adoption**:

Most organizations simply aren't equipped to run a global SOC with multiple shifts, creating complexity in managing sophisticated security platforms 24/7/365

. This creates buyer demand for managed services over point solutions.

5. **AI/Agentic Automation is Differentiator, Not Optional**:

While automation is increasingly table stakes, MDR must remain human-led—AI should support, not replace skilled analysts

. Buyers evaluate vendors on AI integration quality and explainability.

6. **Market M&A Consolidation Signals Sector Shift**:

A wave of acquisitions between EDR and MDR vendors stems from changing competitive landscape and customer needs, with vendors like CrowdStrike offering managed services and Arctic Wolf acquiring Cylance to evolve from services-based to product-centric strategy

.

7. **Zero Trust and SASE Market Expanding Rapidly**:

Zero trust is no longer forward-thinking—it's the baseline, with Gartner predicting 70% of new remote access deployments will rely on ZTNA rather than VPNs by 2025

. This creates new evaluation categories for buyers.

8. **Compliance and Regulatory Pressure Accelerating Adoption**:

CISA sets specific EDR requirements for federal agencies focusing on immediate monitoring and automated response, with organizations needing detailed EDR solutions to detect threats early and respond quickly

.

9. **Multi-Cloud Complexity Fueling CSPM/IAM Demand**:

Organizations are investing in advanced authentication, identity governance, and privilege management solutions as cloud adoption, remote work, and zero-trust architectures accelerate

.

10. **Buyer Expectations for Integration and Interoperability**:

MDR must extend far beyond endpoints—effective detection increasingly requires visibility across IaaS platforms (AWS/Azure), SaaS environments (Microsoft 365/Google Workspace), and identity systems

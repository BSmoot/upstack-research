# TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP (CIO/CTO/CISO) INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 5 KEY INSIGHTS

CIOs face a convergence of unprecedented pressures: 75% report difficulties balancing AI integration with operational excellence, while they're simultaneously pulled into operational crises rather than strategic transformation due to staff and skill shortages.



Top CIO challenges center on five areas: AI strategy, data and analytics, demonstrating IT business value, cybersecurity, and talent—with these challenges fundamentally changing what success means for technology leaders.



In 2025, 82% of CIOs report their role is becoming more digital and innovation-focused, with 81% agreeing the CIO is now a business changemaker, leading both technology and business initiatives.



Technology buying cycles have expanded beyond six months due to distributed decision-making (averaging 31-33 stakeholders), but automation is expected to accelerate purchasing decisions over the next 12 months.



Vendor consolidation has emerged as the dominant CIO priority for 2025, with 68% of technology leaders planning to consolidate their vendor landscape, targeting 20% reductions in vendor count.

## ROLE DEFINITION & EVOLUTION

### CIO: Chief Information Officer

The CIO ensures business processes run efficiently, promoting employee and business unit productivity, managing ongoing operations and mission-critical systems, and overseeing security from help desks and enterprise systems to service delivery and program management.



The CIO role initially focused on reliable technology service delivery with uptime as the main success measure, but has become increasingly strategic as organizations became dependent on technology to operate and compete.

### CTO: Chief Technology Officer

The CIO oversees the IT ecosystem supporting organizational operations and manages the IT department handling day-to-day work to keep the internal IT environment running effectively. The CTO is typically the tech executive leading customer- or client-facing technology programs, responsible for bringing tech products and services to market.



The critical difference: CIOs focus on improving internal technology, while CTOs are customer-facing and centered on improving technology externally.

### CISO: Chief Information Security Officer

86% of CISOs report the role has changed so fundamentally since they became a CISO that it's almost a different job, with the role shifting from primarily technical to more of a business leadership position.



Regulatory pressure and attack surface expansion will result in 45% of CISOs' remits expanding beyond cybersecurity by 2027.



In 2019, only 24% of CISOs reported to a CIO, while 40% reported directly to a CEO, and 27% bypassed the CEO to report to the board.

The CISO role has evolved from technical roots into a position bridging cybersecurity, business strategy, and organizational leadership, operating where cybersecurity intersects with business strategy, regulatory pressure, and operational resilience.

### Career Paths to These Roles

CIOs typically begin as technology specialists who develop business acumen, while CTOs may remain immersed in technology specialties throughout their careers. It may take 5-15 years to attain a top IT management position, though a few stars capture these jobs much faster.

## TOP 5 PAIN POINTS & PRESSURES

### 1. AI Integration vs. Operational Excellence Paradox

75% of CIOs report difficulties balancing AI usage in the enterprise with existing IT operational excellence.



While 92% of CIOs anticipate AI will be integrated into their organizations by 2025, 49% admit their organizations struggle to assess and showcase AI's value.



A major challenge is scaling AI pilot projects; many use cases work well in pilots but fail to scale, and CIOs struggle to move beyond proof of concepts and measure value effectively.

### 2. Talent Shortage & Skills Gaps

Despite growing influence and increasing budgets, CIOs face a major roadblock: staff and skills shortages. Instead of focusing on innovation and transformation, CIOs are pulled into operational challenges, managing understaffed teams and addressing technical expertise gaps, slowing progress on AI adoption, security enhancements, and digital transformation.



IT managers are under strain managing thousands of devices, applications and requests before they even start roadmaps for AI, compounded by a widening IT skills gap and a more distributed workforce.

### 3. Cybersecurity: Scale of Threats & Complexity

CIOs cite the "sheer pace of change" and "increasingly sophisticated attacks" as reasons for cybersecurity remaining their top priority year after year.



Threat actors are increasingly using AI, causing CIOs to focus on "securing the organization around the threat of AI more than we are focusing on utilizing AI."



CIOs report "security overload" with 20+ products to manage, noting "we keep getting things to make you safer, but at some point, it's too much, and you can't move."

### 4. Technology Debt vs. Modern Transformation Pressure

Forrester reports that 30% of IT leaders struggle with high or critical debt, while 49% more face moderate levels, with technical debt impacts changing quickly as business needs evolve.



CIOs estimate technical debt amounts to 20-40% of the value of their entire technology estate.



Technical debt is a direct barrier to new digital initiatives; AI integration is hampered by legacy systems and poor data connections, delaying development and reducing competitiveness, with many AI projects ending as proof of concepts that never materialize.

### 5. Pressure to Demonstrate Business Value & ROI

CIOs face a volatile and uncertain economic environment with pressure to demonstrate measurable value, maximize investments, optimize costs, while still driving key digital initiatives forward.



Just 26% of CIOs rate themselves as "expert" in strategically managing IT budgets while balancing cost, value and risk at an enterprise level, though effective budget management is key to being a successful CIO.



The real measure of success for IT lies in its ROI on initiatives—demonstrating tangible results like lowered operating costs, deferred headcount through automation, and stronger margins through optimization, communicating business impact rather than just technical performance.

---

## DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY MAP

CIOs and CTOs typically have authority to approve large expenditures and are accountable for investment success, leading all stages of the IT purchase process from setting requirements to final selection.



However, influence is distributed: buying committees are expanding to include many stakeholders for consensus-driven decisions, with the average enterprise tech buying team involving 33 people (17 from IT and 16 from LOB).

The IT budget is typically overseen by the CIO. However, as IT has become central to business results, the scope and allocation of IT budgets have become more complex because not all IT spending falls within the IT department.

---

## COMMUNICATION & CONTENT PREFERENCES

CIOs build networks through industry events, conferences, trade shows and networking events, participate in professional groups and forums online, use LinkedIn to connect with other professionals and industry groups, and volunteer or speak at events to build their brand and increase visibility.



The CIO Professional Network is an invitation-only, vendor-free private platform for CIOs to network and collaborate, featuring discussion forums, curated content, personal branding opportunities, and career search materials.

Communication skills are among the top factors determining whether the CIO leads business transformation or is relegated to keeping the lights on. Business leaders are turned off by techno-speak and acronyms; using technical language outside IT is like speaking a foreign language audiences don't understand.

---

## BUYING BEHAVIOR & VENDOR SELECTION

### Procurement Process & Timeline

Around 66% of ITDMs in APAC agree that the purchase process for technology products and services is becoming increasingly complex.



The entire buying cycle for large projects takes over half a year because of multiple influencers and more voices being heard during the purchase process, though increased automation is expected to accelerate tech purchase decisions.

### CIO Vendor Selection Criteria

CIOs never take on a new vendor without speaking to at least two or three companies that have used that vendor before, actively using references to evaluate vendors rather than simply checking the box.



CIOs want to find in suppliers all the knowledge they don't have in-house, but vendors often send experienced sales managers during sales phase and less experienced people during project phase—a mistake vendors must avoid.

CIOs don't want a partner who simply settles for a supply contract; instead, vendors must constantly offer new solutions for technologies, use cases, and methodological approaches, and expect proactivity from suppliers with long-standing relationships who know them well.

### Skepticism & Trust Requirements

Many CIOs have become enamored with what they believe AI is capable of, having a false sense of security about AI; the misconception lies in thinking AI automatically enhances processes ("If you add hot sauce to a cake mix, it doesn't necessarily make it better").



Depending on AI vendors for transparency and protection isn't enough; enterprises must rely on their own abilities to audit tools, reinforce governance standards, and mitigate risks.

Trust comes down to vendors being forthcoming with information about risks and vulnerabilities; CIOs need to know beforehand what type of risk they're assuming and require accurate vulnerability information from cloud providers.

### Value of Trusted Advisors

More than 90% of CIOs across healthcare, manufacturing, retail and other sectors said they rely on "trusted advisors" to navigate new technologies, processes and methodologies.



CIOs look to strategic vendors, consultants, former colleagues, and CIO peers for help as trusted advisors, who serve as sounding boards, empathetic listeners, and ideally enable IT leaders to consider new points of view.

---

## KPIs & SUCCESS METRICS

Five essential metrics CIOs should track: IT Return on Investment (ROI), Business Value Delivered, System Uptime Rate, Rate of Change, and Average Time to Resolution (ATR).



The trap is focusing on IT-centric performance metrics—such as uptime, system availability, and IT spending—without linking them to broader business outcomes like revenue growth, customer experience, and innovation.

CIOs need two separate sets of digital business KPIs: progress in digitalizing existing domains (sales, marketing, operations, supply chain, products, customer service), and new digital business models reflecting growth, revenue, market share and margin metrics differentiated from non-digital sources.

---

## MESSAGING GUIDELINES FOR TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP

### Language That Resonates

Business is the language of business people.



IT Strategy must be expressed in terms of measurable goals, articulating specifically how strategic objectives will increase revenue, reduce costs, improve customer experience, or mitigate risk.

### What Captures Attention

IT Value is demonstrated by revenue gained and costs reduced as a result of IT work, particularly through showing the value created by major projects where executive sponsors commit to revenue gains or cost savings prior to project initiation and IT tracks delivery costs.

### Tone & Approach

Avoid technical jargon and acronyms; frame technology decisions in business outcomes. Focus on risk mitigation, revenue impact, and competitive advantage. Acknowledge the real constraints CIOs face (talent shortage, legacy systems, budget pressures) rather than overselling solutions.

---

## OBJECTIONS & SKEPTICISM

CIOs approach vendor claims with earned skepticism, grounded in past experiences with failed implementations, AI hype, and overpromised capabilities. Common concerns:

- **AI-washing**: Vendors claiming AI integration that's minimal or non-existent
- **Unproven at Scale**: Solutions that work in pilots but fail production rollout
- **Hidden Costs**: Implementation and change management expenses not surfaced upfront
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Concerns about migration difficulty and contractual dependence
- **Talent Risk**: Solutions requiring expertise not available in market

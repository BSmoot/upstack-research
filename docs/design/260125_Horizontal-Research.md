AGENT 1: BUYER JOURNEY RESEARCH
Core Question: How do enterprises in our target verticals currently discover, evaluate, and select technology solutions - and where does vendor-neutral advisory fit (or not fit)?
Research Vectors:
1.	Discovery Triggers 
o	What events/problems cause enterprises to seek new technology solutions?
o	Internal triggers: budget cycles, compliance changes, performance issues, M&A, leadership changes
o	External triggers: vendor end-of-life notices, security incidents, competitive pressure
o	Industry-specific patterns per vertical
2.	Current Evaluation Process 
o	Who is involved? (titles, departments, decision rights)
o	What evaluation criteria matter? (cost, performance, vendor relationship, compliance, risk)
o	Typical timeline from trigger to decision
o	Information sources: analyst firms, peer networks, vendor direct, consultants, RFPs
o	Where do buyers get stuck or experience friction?
3.	Advisory Model Awareness 
o	Do buyers know vendor-neutral advisory exists as a category?
o	If yes: how did they learn about it, what language do they use?
o	If no: what adjacent models do they confuse it with? (consultants, VARs, MSPs)
o	What would make them consider using an advisor vs. going direct?
4.	AI-Mediated Discovery 
o	How are buyers using ChatGPT, Perplexity, enterprise search to research solutions?
o	What questions are they asking AI systems?
o	What answers are AI systems giving (and who is cited)?
Deliverable: Buyer journey map per vertical showing trigger → discovery → evaluation → decision, with explicit callouts for where advisory model intersects (or doesn't) and what questions/content would influence each stage.

AGENT 2: COMPETITIVE CHANNELS RESEARCH
Core Question: Where do competitors (direct and adjacent) show up in buyer awareness, and what makes them visible or credible?
Research Vectors:
1.	Direct Competitors (other vendor-neutral advisors)

o	Where do they appear in search results, analyst reports, industry media?
o	What content/thought leadership are they producing?
o	What partnerships/integrations are they promoting?
o	What customer proof points are they using?
2.	Adjacent Competitors (consultants, VARs, MSPs, direct vendors) 
o	Accenture, Deloitte, Gartner, McKinsey (strategic advisory)
o	CDW, SHI, Insight (VARs)
o	Managed service providers competing for IT outsourcing
o	Direct vendor sales orgs (AT&T, Lumen, Equinix, etc.)
o	How do they position against "vendor-neutral advisory"?
o	What jobs-to-be-done are they claiming?
3.	Channel Visibility Analysis 
o	Organic search: what queries surface competitors, what content ranks?
o	AI answer engines: who gets cited when asking procurement questions?
o	Industry analyst coverage: who appears in Gartner/Forrester categories?
o	Event presence: who sponsors/speaks at key industry conferences?
o	Referral networks: who has strong partner ecosystems?
4.	Messaging & Differentiation 
o	What value props are competitors leading with?
o	What proof points/case studies are they showing?
o	What language patterns repeat across competitors?
o	Where are there gaps or weaknesses in their positioning?
Deliverable: Competitive visibility matrix showing where each competitor type appears across channels, plus messaging analysis identifying language/positioning patterns and gaps we can exploit.

AGENT 3: CUSTOMER EXPANSION RESEARCH
Core Question: How do existing enterprise technology relationships expand from initial engagement to deeper partnership - and what drives that expansion?
Research Vectors:
1.	Expansion Patterns 
o	Initial entry point: what's the first engagement typically?
o	Expansion paths: connectivity → security → cloud → CX? Single category deep vs. multi-category wide?
o	Timeline: how long from first engagement to second category? To becoming strategic partner?
o	Signals of readiness: what indicates a customer is ready to expand?
2.	Cross-Sell Dynamics 
o	Who initiates expansion: customer request vs. advisor recommendation?
o	What triggers cross-category discussions? (integration needs, consolidation, new projects)
o	Role of trust/relationship vs. demonstrated expertise
o	Organizational dynamics: same buyer vs. new stakeholders for new categories
3.	Upsell vs. Cross-Sell 
o	Upsell: deeper engagement within existing category (more sites, more bandwidth, more features)
o	Cross-sell: new category entirely (networking → security, connectivity → cloud)
o	Which drives more revenue? Which drives more stickiness?
o	Compensation/ownership: who owns cross-sell in successful firms?
4.	Barriers to Expansion 
o	Why don't customers expand? (satisfied with current scope, vendor lock-in, internal politics, budget)
o	When do customers bring in multiple advisors vs. consolidate?
o	What causes customers to go direct to vendors for new categories?
Deliverable: Expansion playbook identifying high-probability paths (initial engagement → expansion triggers → cross-sell/upsell patterns) with tactics for accelerating customer lifetime value growth.

AGENT 4: MESSAGING RESEARCH
Core Question: What language, framing, and proof points resonate with enterprise buyers when they encounter vendor-neutral advisory - and what creates confusion or skepticism?
Research Vectors:
1.	Language That Works 
o	How do buyers describe their problem? (direct quotes from case studies, reviews, forums)
o	What metaphors/analogies help them understand the model? ("buying agent for tech," "independent financial advisor," "procurement specialist")
o	What benefits language resonates: cost savings, risk mitigation, time savings, expertise access?
o	Industry-specific terminology per vertical (healthcare compliance, financial regulatory, legal security)
2.	Language That Fails 
o	What terms create confusion? ("master agent," "TSD," "broker," "channel partner")
o	What value props trigger skepticism? ("free," "vendor-neutral," "best-in-class")
o	What analogies don't land? (real estate agent? insurance broker?)
3.	Proof Point Analysis 
o	What evidence makes the model credible?
o	Quantified outcomes: cost savings %, time saved, risk reduced
o	Process descriptions: "how we actually work"
o	Customer testimonials: what specific quotes/stories build trust?
o	Certifications, partnerships, data assets mentioned
4.	Objection Patterns 
o	"Why not go direct to vendors?" (what's the compelling counter?)
o	"How do you stay neutral if vendors pay you?" (what explanation works?)
o	"What if you recommend wrong solution?" (what reduces perceived risk?)
o	"We have internal IT - why do we need you?" (what's the adjacency, not replacement, story?)
5.	AEO Content Angles 
o	What questions are buyers asking AI systems related to technology procurement?
o	What format/structure makes answers authoritative and cite-worthy?
o	What depth level: high-level overview vs. detailed implementation guide?
Deliverable: Messaging framework with (1) recommended language per vertical, (2) proof point library by claim type, (3) objection handling scripts, (4) AEO content angle priority ranked by buyer question frequency and current gap in available answers.

VERTICAL RESEARCH SPECIFICATION (LAYER 2)
Research Context: Technology advisory firm (vendor-neutral, commission-based) adapting horizontal findings to specific industry verticals. Each vertical has unique regulatory environments, buying patterns, and pain points that require tailored messaging and go-to-market approaches.
Output Requirements: Each vertical agent delivers industry-specific research that builds on Layer 1 horizontal findings. Outputs feed into Layer 3 title research and final playbook generation for ABM campaigns.

VERTICAL AGENT: INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC RESEARCH
Core Question: How does infrastructure advisory fit differently in this specific vertical - and what unique dynamics of regulation, buying behavior, and pain points require adapted positioning?

Research Vectors:

o	Are there vertical-specific advisory firms or specialists?
o	What are common vendor selection criteria?
o	How do companies in this vertical typically engage advisors?
o	What incumbent relationships create switching barriers?
o	Who competes for the same budget dollars?

6.	Vertical Value Proposition
o	How should an advisory firm's value proposition adapt for this vertical?
o	What vertical-specific proof points are needed?
o	What objections are unique to this vertical?

EXECUTION CONTEXT

Dependencies:
- Requires completed Layer 1 horizontal research (all 5 agents)
- Uses buyer journey, competitive, expansion, and messaging findings as foundation

Parallel Execution:
- All vertical agents execute in parallel after Layer 1 completion
- Each vertical agent independent (no cross-vertical dependencies)

Context Injection:
- Layer 1 context automatically injected into each vertical prompt
- Vertical agent builds on horizontal findings, identifies vertical-specific differences

Output Usage:
- Feeds into Layer 3 title cluster research
- Combined with Layer 3 for playbook generation
- Informs vertical-specific marketing campaigns

Methodology:
- Use 40-60 web_search operations per vertical
- Prioritize: Industry analyst reports, trade publications, regulatory docs, vertical-specific case studies
- Look for vertical-specific data and statistics
- Compare to general B2B patterns from Layer 1 research
- Every major claim needs source citations
- Flag low-confidence areas explicitly
